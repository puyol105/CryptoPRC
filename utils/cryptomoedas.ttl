		:about "Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency originally described in a 2008 whitepaper by a person, or group of people, using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. It was launched soon after, in January 2009.Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer online currency, meaning that all transactions happen directly between equal, independent network participants, without the need for any intermediary to permit or facilitate them. Bitcoin was created, according to Nakamoto’s own words, to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”Some concepts for a similar type of a decentralized electronic currency precede BTC, but Bitcoin holds the distinction of being the first-ever cryptocurrency to come into actual use.Bitcoin’s original inventor is known under a pseudonym, Satoshi Nakamoto. As of 2020, the true identity of the person — or organization — that is behind the alias remains unknown.On October 31, 2008, Nakamoto published Bitcoin’s whitepaper, which described in detail how a peer-to-peer, online currency could be implemented. They proposed to use a decentralized ledger of transactions packaged in batches (called “blocks”) and secured by cryptographic algorithms — the whole system would later be dubbed “blockchain.”Just two months later, on January 3, 2009, Nakamoto mined the first block on the Bitcoin network, known as the genesis block, thus launching the world’s first cryptocurrency.However, while Nakamoto was the original inventor of Bitcoin, as well as the author of its very first implementation, over the years a large number of people have contributed to improving the cryptocurrency’s software by patching vulnerabilities and adding new features.Bitcoin’s source code repository on GitHub lists more than 750 contributors, with some of the key ones being Wladimir J. van der Laan, Marco Falke, Pieter Wuille, Gavin Andresen, Jonas Schnelli and others.Bitcoin’s most unique advantage comes from the fact that it was the very first cryptocurrency to appear on the market.It has managed to create a global community and give birth to an entirely new industry of millions of enthusiasts who create, invest in, trade and use Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in their everyday lives. The emergence of the first cryptocurrency has created a conceptual and technological basis that subsequently inspired the development of thousands of competing projects.The entire cryptocurrency market — now worth more than $300 billion — is based on the idea realized by Bitcoin: money that can be sent and received by anyone, anywhere in the world without reliance on trusted intermediaries, such as banks and financial services companies.Thanks to its pioneering nature, BTC remains at the top of this energetic market after over a decade of existence. Even after Bitcoin has lost its undisputed dominance, it remains the largest cryptocurrency, with a market capitalization that fluctuated between $100-$200 billion in 2020, owing in large part to the ubiquitousness of platforms that provide use-cases for BTC: wallets, exchanges, payment services, online games and more.Looking for market and blockchain data for BTC?

New coins are created during the process known as “mining”: as transactions are relayed across the network, they get picked up by miners and packaged into blocks, which are in turn protected by complex cryptographic calculations.As compensation for spending their computational resources, the miners receive rewards for every block that they successfully add to the blockchain. At the moment of Bitcoin’s launch, the reward was 50 bitcoins per block: this number gets halved with every 210,000 new blocks mined — which takes the network roughly four years. As of 2020, the block reward has been halved three times and comprises 6.25 bitcoins.Bitcoin has not been premined, meaning that no coins have been mined and/or distributed between the founders before it became available to the public. However, during the first few years of BTC’s existence, the competition between miners was relatively low, allowing the earliest network participants to accumulate significant amounts of coins via regular mining: Satoshi Nakamoto alone is believed to own over a million Bitcoin.Mining Bitcoins can be very profitable for miners, depending on the current hash rate and the price of Bitcoin. While the process of mining Bitcoins is complex, we discuss how long it takes to mine one Bitcoin on CMC Alexandria — as we wrote above, mining Bitcoin is best understood as how long it takes to mine one block, as opposed to one Bitcoin.Bitcoin is secured with the SHA-256 algorithm, which belongs to the SHA-2 family of hashing algorithms, which is also used by its fork Bitcoin Cash (BCH), as well as several other cryptocurrencies.Bitcoin is the first decentralized, peer-to-peer digital currency. One of its most important functions is that it is used as a decentralized store of value. In other words, it provides for ownership rights as a physical asset or as a unit of account. However, the latter store-of-value function has been debated. Many crypto enthusiasts and economists believe that high-scale adoption of the top currency will lead us to a new modern financial world where transaction amounts will be denominated in smaller units.The top crypto is considered a store of value, like gold, for many — rather than a currency. This idea of the first cryptocurrency as a store of value, instead of a payment method, means that many people buy the crypto and hold onto it long-term (or HODL) rather than spending it on items like you would typically spend a dollar — treating it as digital gold.The most popular wallets for cryptocurrency include both hot and cold wallets. Cryptocurrency wallets vary from hot wallets and cold wallets. Hot wallets are able to be connected to the web, while cold wallets are used for keeping large amounts of coins outside of the internet.Some of the top crypto cold wallets are Trezor, Ledger and CoolBitX. Some of the top crypto hot wallets include Exodus, Electrum and Mycelium.A hard fork is a radical change to the protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid, and therefore requires all users to upgrade. For example, if users A and B are disagreeing on whether an incoming transaction is valid, a hard fork could make the transaction valid to users A and B, but not to user C.A hard fork is a protocol upgrade that is not backward compatible. This means every node (computer connected to the Bitcoin network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) needs to upgrade before the new blockchain with the hard fork activates and rejects any blocks or transactions from the old blockchain. The old blockchain will continue to exist and will continue to accept transactions, although it may be incompatible with other newer Bitcoin clients.A soft fork is a change to the Bitcoin protocol wherein only previously valid blocks/transactions are made invalid. Since old nodes will recognise the new blocks as valid, a soft fork is backward-compatible. This kind of fork requires only a majority of the miners upgrading to enforce the new rules.Some examples of prominent cryptocurrencies that have undergone hard forks are the following: Bitcoin’s hard fork that resulted in Bitcoin Cash, Ethereum’s hard fork that resulted in Ethereum Classic.https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/bitcoin-vs-bitcoin-cash-vs-bitcoin-svBitcoin Cash has been hard forked since its original forking, with the creation of Bitcoin SV.The Lightning Network is an off-chain, layered payment protocol that operates bidirectional payment channels which allows instantaneous transfer with instant reconciliation. It enables private, high volume and trustless transactions between any two parties. The Lightning Network scales transaction capacity without incurring the costs associated with transactions and interventions on the underlying blockchain.The current valuation of Bitcoin is constantly moving, all day every day. It is a truly global asset. From a start of under one cent per coin, BTC has risen in price by thousands of percent to the numbers you see above. The prices of all cryptocurrencies are quite volatile, meaning that anyone’s understanding of how much is Bitcoin will change by the minute. However, there are times when different countries and exchanges show different prices and understanding how much is Bitcoin will be a function of a person’s location.Bitcoin is, in many regards, almost synonymous with cryptocurrency, which means that you can buy Bitcoin on virtually every crypto exchange — both for fiat money and other cryptocurrencies. Some of the main markets where BTC trading is available are:If you are new to crypto, use CoinMarketCap’s own easy guide to buying Bitcoin." ;

		:about "Ethereum is a decentralized open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. ETH works as a platform for numerous other cryptocurrencies, as well as for the execution of decentralized smart contracts.Ethereum was first described in a 2013 whitepaper by Vitalik Buterin. Buterin, along with other co-founders, secured funding for the project in an online public crowd sale in the summer of 2014 and officially launched the blockchain on July 30, 2015.Ethereum’s own purported goal is to become a global platform for decentralized applications, allowing users from all over the world to write and run software that is resistant to censorship, downtime and fraud.Ethereum has a total of eight co-founders — an unusually large number for a crypto project. They first met on June 7, 2014, in Zug, Switzerland.Russian-Canadian Vitalik Buterin is perhaps the best known of the bunch. He authored the original white paper that first described Ethereum in 2013 and still works on improving the platform to this day. Prior to ETH, Buterin co-founded and wrote for the Bitcoin Magazine news website.British programmer Gavin Wood is arguably the second most important co-founder of ETH, as he coded the first technical implementation of Ethereum in the C++ programming language, proposed Ethereum’s native programming language Solidity and was the first chief technology officer of the Ethereum Foundation. Before Ethereum, Wood was a research scientist at Microsoft. Afterward, he moved on to establish the Web3 Foundation.Among the other co-founders of Ethereum are: - Anthony Di Iorio, who underwrote the project during its early stage of development. - Charles Hoskinson, who played the principal role in establishing the Swiss-based Ethereum Foundation and its legal framework. - Mihai Alisie, who provided assistance in establishing the Ethereum Foundation. - Joseph Lubin, a Canadian entrepreneur, who, like Di Iorio, has helped fund Ethereum during its early days, and later founded an incubator for startups based on ETH called ConsenSys. - Amir Chetrit, who helped co-found Ethereum but stepped away from it early into the development.Ethereum has pioneered the concept of a blockchain smart contract platform. Smart contracts are computer programs that automatically execute the actions necessary to fulfill an agreement between several parties on the internet. They were designed to reduce the need for trusted intermediates between contractors, thus reducing transaction costs while also increasing transaction reliability.Ethereum’s principal innovation was designing a platform that allowed it to execute smart contracts using the blockchain, which further reinforces the already existing benefits of smart contract technology. Ethereum’s blockchain was designed, according to co-founder Gavin Wood, as a sort of “one computer for the entire planet,” theoretically able to make any program more robust, censorship-resistant and less prone to fraud by running it on a globally distributed network of public nodes.In addition to smart contracts, Ethereum’s blockchain is able to host other cryptocurrencies, called “tokens,” through the use of its ERC-20 compatibility standard. In fact, this has been the most common use for the ETH platform so far: to date, more than 280,000 ERC-20-compliant tokens have been launched. Over 40 of these make the top-100 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, for example, USDT, LINK and BNB.New to crypto? Learn how to buy Bitcoin today.Ready to learn more? Visit our learning hub.Want to look up a transaction? Visit our block explorer.Curious about the crypto space? Read our blog!In August 2020, there were around 112 million ETH coins in circulation, 72 million of which were issued in the genesis block — the first ever block on the Ethereum blockchain. Of these 72 million, 60 million were allocated to the initial contributors to the 2014 crowd sale that funded the project, and 12 million were given to the development fund.The remaining amount has been issued in the form of block rewards to the miners on the Ethereum network. The original reward in 2015 was 5 ETH per block, which later went down to 3 ETH in late 2017 and then to 2 ETH in early 2019. The average time it takes to mine an Ethereum block is around 13-15 seconds.One of the major differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum’s economics is that the latter is not deflationary, i.e. its total supply is not limited. Ethereum’s developers justify this by not wanting to have a “fixed security budget” for the network. Being able to adjust ETH’s issuance rate via consensus allows the network to maintain the minimum issuance needed for adequate security.As of August 2020, Ethereum is secured via the Ethash proof-of-work algorithm, belonging to the Keccak family of hash functions.There are plans, however, to transition the network to a proof-of-stake algorithm tied to the major Ethereum 2.0 update, which launched in late 2020.After the Ethereum 2.0 Beacon Chain (Phase 0) went live in the beginning of December 2020, it became possible to begin staking on the Ethereum 2.0 network. An Ethereum stake is when you deposit ETH (acting as a validator) on Ethereum 2.0 by sending it to a deposit contract, basically acting as a miner and thus securing the network. At the time of writing in mid-December 2020, the Ethereum stake price, or the amount of money earned daily by Ethereum validators, is about 0.00403 ETH a day, or $2.36. This number will change as the network develops and the amount of stakers (validators) increase.Ethereum staking rewards are determined by a distribution curve (the participation and average percent of stakers): some ETH 2.0 staking rewards are at 20% for early stakers, but will be lowered to end up between 7% and 4.5% annually.The minimum requirements for an Ethereum stake are 32 ETH. If you decide to stake in Ethereum 2.0, it means that your Ethererum stake will be locked up on the network for months, if not years, in the future until the Ethereum 2.0 upgrade is completed.Given the fact that Ethereum is the second-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin, it is possible to buy Ethereum, or use ETH trading pairs on nearly all of the major crypto exchanges.

		:about "USDT is a stablecoin (stable-value cryptocurrency) that mirrors the price of the U.S. dollar, issued by a Hong Kong-based company Tether. The token’s peg to the USD is achieved via maintaining a sum of dollars in reserves that is equal to the number of USDT in circulation.Originally launched in July 2014 as Realcoin, a second-layer cryptocurrency token built on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain through the use of the Omni platform, it was later renamed to USTether, and then, finally, to USDT. In addition to Bitcoin’s, USDT was later updated to work on the Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, and OMG blockchains.The stated purpose of USDT is to combine the unrestricted nature of cryptocurrencies — which can be sent between users without a trusted third-party intermediary — with the stable value of the US dollar.USDT — or as it was known at the time, Realcoin — was launched in 2014 by Brock Pierce, Reeve Collins and Craig Sellars.Brock Pierce is a well-known entrepreneur who has co-founded a number of high-profile projects in the crypto and entertainment industries. In 2013, he co-founded a venture capital firm Blockchain Capital, which by 2017 had raised over $80 million in funding. In 2014, Pierce became the director of the Bitcoin Foundation, a nonprofit established to help improve and promote Bitcoin. Pierce has also co-founded Block.one, the company behind EOS, one of the largest cryptocurrencies on the market.Reeve Collins was the CEO of Tether for the first two years of its existence. Prior to that, he had co-founded several successful companies, such as the online ad network Traffic Marketplace, entertainment studio RedLever and gambling website Pala Interactive. As of 2020, Collins is heading SmarMedia Technologies, a marketing and advertising tech company.Other than working on Tether, Craig Sellars has been a member of the Omni Foundation for over six years. Its Omni Protocol allows users to create and trade smart-contract based properties and currencies on top of Bitcoin’s blockchain. Sellars has also worked in several other cryptocurrency companies and organizations, such as Bitfinex, Factom, Synereo and the MaidSafe Foundation.USDT’s unique feature is the fact that its value is guaranteed by Tether to remain pegged to the U.S. dollar. According to Tether, whenever it issues new USDT tokens, it allocates the same amount of USD to its reserves, thus ensuring that USDT is fully backed by cash and cash equivalents.The famously high volatility of the crypto markets means that cryptocurrencies can rise or fall by 10-20% within a single day, making them unreliable as a store of value. USDT, on the other hand, is protected from these fluctuations.This property makes USDT a safe haven for crypto investors: during periods of high volatility, they can park their portfolios in Tether without having to completely cash out into USD. In addition, USDT provides a simple way to transact a U.S. dollar equivalent between regions, countries and even continents via blockchain — without having to rely on a slow and expensive intermediary, like a bank or a financial services provider.However, over the years, there have been a number of controversies regarding the validity of Tether’s claims about their USD reserves, at times disrupting USDT’s price, which went down as low as $0.88 at one point in its history. Many have raised concerns about the fact that Tether’s reserves have never been fully audited by an independent third party.Looking for market and blockchain data for BTC? Visit our block explorer.Want to buy crypto? Use CoinMarketCap’s guide.There is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of USDT — given the fact that it belongs to a private company, theoretically, its issuance is limited only by Tether’s own policies. However, because Tether claims that every single USDT is supposed to be backed by one U.S. dollar, the amount of tokens is limited by the company’s actual cash reserves.Moreover, Tether does not disclose its issuance schedules ahead of time. Instead, they provide daily transparency reports, listing the total amount of their asset reserves and liabilities, the latter corresponding to the amount of USDT in circulation.As of September 2020, there are over 14.4 billion USDT tokens in circulation, which are backed by $14.6 billion in assets, according to Tether.USDT does not have its own blockchain — instead, it operates as a second-layer token on top of other cryptocurrencies’ blockchains: Bitcoin, Ethereum, EOS, Tron, Algorand, Bitcoin Cash and OMG, and is secured by their respective hashing algorithms.It is possible to buy Tether / USDT on a large number of cryptocurrency exchanges. In fact, USDT’s average daily trading volume is often on par or even exceeds that of Bitcoin. It is especially prominent on those exchanges where fiat-to-crypto trading pairs are unavailable, as it provides a viable alternative to USD. Here are some of the most popular exchanges that support Tether trading:" ;

		:about "Launched in July 2017, Binance is one of the biggest cryptocurrency exchanges globally. By aiming to bring cryptocurrency exchanges to the forefront of financial activity globally. The idea behind Binance’s name is to show this new paradigm in global finance — Binary Finance, or Binance.Aside from being the largest cryptocurrency exchange globally, Binance has launched a whole ecosystem of functionalities for its users. The Binance network includes the Binance Chain, Academy, Trusted Wallet and Research projects, which all employ the powers of blockchain technology to bring new-age finance to the world. Binance Coin is an integral part of the successful functioning of many of the Binance sub-projects. Changpeng Zhao is the founder and CEO of Binance. In 2001, Zhao joined Bloomberg as head of tradebook futures development. He spent four years with the company and later joined Fusion Systems as a partner. Since 2013, Changpeng Zhao has been actively involved with blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. He became head of development at Blockchain, and in 2015 he founded BijieTech. In 2017, Zhao officially launched Binance, and he has been the CEO of the company ever since. He Yi is a co-founder and chief marketing officer at Binance. She started her career as a TV anchor and presenter on China Travel TV in 2012. Later, in 2014, Yi co-founded OKCoin, which was the largest fiat-to-crypto exchange in China at the time. In 2017, she joined forces with Changpeng Zhao, and together they created the largest crypto exchange globally — Binance. Binance is a unique ecosystem of decentralized, blockchain-based networks. The company has grown to be the leading crypto exchange in a number of countries, and their side organizations are attracting significant interest as well. One of the biggest competitive advantages Binance has is its drive for development. While the company started only as a crypto exchange back in 2017, today, Binance has spread its services among numerous different spheres. According to the company website, its mission is to become the infrastructure services provider for the entire blockchain ecosystem.Since launching the Binance Coin, the exchange has also benefited from increased investor interest in the token. BNB went through a significant price increase at the beginning of 2021, which has put it on the map of enterprise investors.Read more about Elrond.Find out more about bZx protocol.Learn more about DApps.Binance is launching an NFT marketplace.What are crypto debit cards?There is a maximum supply of 170,532,785 BNB coins, of which 153,432,897 are currently in circulation as of April 2021. According to the Binance whitepaper, exactly half of the maximum supply of BNB tokens was allocated towards the initial coin offering (ICO) and public sale of the token. Another 40% of the total supply, or around 80,000,000 BNB coins, was distributed among the founding members and team. Finally, the remaining 10% of the maximum supply was split among angel investors. Initially, the Binance coin started as a traditional ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain. Later on, the company introduced its own blockchain, and the coins started being issued from the Binance blockchain, secured by the Tendermint byzantine-fault-tolerant (BFT) consensus mechanism.While ERC-20 tokens rely on the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus, which allows them to be extremely scalable, and allows for the creation of smart contracts. Unlike PoS, the Binance blockchain does not support smart contract functionalities. In contrast, the Bitcoin blockchain is secured by the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus, which is far more limited and consumes large amounts of electrical and computing power. As the dedicated utility token of the Binance exchange, the most straightforward way to acquire BNB coins would be to purchase them through Binance. The original exchange supports the largest variety of trading pairs with BNB, and it also has the best trading rates for the coin. If you are looking for alternative exchanges where you can purchase BNB, FTX is a good choice. Keep in mind that investing in cryptocurrency can be risky, just like investing in any other type of asset. Find more information here about buying cryptos." ;

		:about "Cardano is a proof-of-stake blockchain platform that says its goal is to allow “changemakers, innovators and visionaries” to bring about positive global change.The open-source project also aims to “redistribute power from unaccountable structures to the margins to individuals” — helping to create a society that is more secure, transparent and fair.Cardano was founded back in 2017, and the ADA token is designed to ensure that owners can participate in the operation of the network. Because of this, those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes to the software.The team behind the layered blockchain say that there have already been some compelling use cases for its technology, which aims to allow decentralized apps and smart contracts to be developed with modularity.Cardano is used by agricultural companies to track fresh produce from field to fork, while other products built on the platform allow educational credentials to be stored in a tamper-proof way, and retailers to clamp down on counterfeit goods.Cardano was founded by Charles Hoskinson, who was also one of the co-founders of the Ethereum network. He is the CEO of IOHK, the company that built Cardano’s blockchain.In an interview for CoinMarketCap’s Crypto Titans series, Hoskinson said that he got involved in cryptocurrencies back in 2011 — and dabbled in mining and trading. He explained that his first professional involvement in the industry came in 2013, when he created a course about Bitcoin that ended up being taken by 80,000 students.As well as being a technology entrepreneur, Hoskinson is also a mathematician. In 2020, his technology company donated ADA worth $500,000 to the University of Wyoming’s Blockchain Research and Development Lab.Cardano is one of the biggest blockchains to successfully use a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, which is less energy intensive than the proof-of-work algorithm relied upon by Bitcoin. Although the much larger Ethereum is going to be upgrading to PoS, this transition is only going to take place gradually.The project has taken pride in ensuring that all of the technology developed goes through a process of peer-reviewed research, meaning that bold ideas can be challenged before they are validated. According to the Cardano team, this academic rigor helps the blockchain to be durable and stable — increasing the chance that potential pitfalls can be anticipated in advance.In 2020, Cardano held a Shelley upgrade that aimed to make its blockchain “50 to 100 times more decentralized” than other large blockchains. At the time, Hoskinson predicted that this would pave the way for hundreds of assets to run on its network.Related Pages:Read our interview with Cardano founder Charles HoskinsonA deep dive into the technology behind Ethereum 2.0Brush up on complicated crypto terms with our glossaryCheck out our other interviews with crypto heavyweights A Deep Dive Into CardanoRead our crypto staking guideThere is a maximum supply of 45 billion ADA — but at the time of writing, there was a circulating supply of about 31 billion. Five rounds of public sales of Cardano tokens were held between September 2015 and January 2017.Approximately 2.5 billion ADA was allotted to IOHK once the network launched. Meanwhile, an additional 2.1 billion ADA was given to Emurgo, a global blockchain technology company that served as a founding entity of the Cardano protocol. Last but not least, 648 million ADA was given to the not-for-profit Cardano Foundation, which aims to promote the platform and increase levels of adoption.Overall, about 16% of ADA’s total supply went to the project’s founders, with the remaining 84% being split among investors.Cardano is secured through an “environmentally sustainable, verifiably secure” PoS protocol that’s known as Ouroboros.The project says that Ouroboros improves upon the security guarantees that are delivered by a PoW consensus mechanism while using substantially less power — claiming that it is four times more energy efficient than Bitcoin.It is described as a blend of unique technology and mathematically verified mechanisms, with behavioral psychology and economic philosophy thrown in for good measure. Overall, the objective of Ouroboros is to achieve sustainable and ethical growth.An incentive mechanism means that participants in the network are rewarded for their involvement.As one of the biggest cryptocurrencies in the world in terms of market capitalization, you shouldn’t have much difficulty in finding a major exchange to buy Cardano on including Binance, Bittrex, eToro, and HitBTC.If you’re struggling to find a trading pair that unites ADA with your local currency, check out this guide on how to convert fiat into Bitcoin — giving you a gateway to buying altcoins." ;

		:about "To begin with, it’s important to understand the difference between XRP, Ripple and RippleNet. XRP is the currency that runs on a digital payment platform called RippleNet, which is on top of a distributed ledger database called XRP Ledger. While RippleNet is run by a company called Ripple, the XRP Ledger is open-source and is not based on blockchain, but rather the previously mentioned distributed ledger database.The RippleNet payment platform is a real-time gross settlement (RTGS) system that aims to enable instant monetary transactions globally. While XRP is the cryptocurrency native to the XRP Ledger, you can actually use any currency to transact on the platform.While the idea behind the Ripple payment platform was first voiced in 2004 by Ryan Fugger, it wasn’t until Jed McCaleb and Chris Larson took over the project in 2012 that Ripple began to be built (at the time, it was also called OpenCoin). XRP was created by Ripple to be a speedy, less costly and more scalable alternative to both other digital assets and existing monetary payment platforms like SWIFT. RippleNet’s ledger is maintained by the global XRP Community, with Ripple the company as an active member. The XRP Ledger processes transactions roughly every 3-5 seconds, or whenever independent validator nodes come to a consensus on both the order and validity of XRP transactions — as opposed to proof-of-work mining like Bitcoin (BTC). Anyone can be a Ripple validator, and the list is currently made up of Ripple along with universities, financial institutions and others.You can buy XRP on any exchange that offers the digital currency.

Remember to do your own research before choosing an exchange!You can either store your XRP on an exchange, where the exchange is responsible for the safety of your asset, or store your XRP in a cold or hot wallet." ;

		:about "Dogecoin (DOGE) is based on the popular doge Internet meme and features a Shiba Inu on its logo. The open-source digital currency was created by Billy Markus from Portland, Oregon and Jackson Palmer from Sydney, Australia, and was forked from Litecoin in December 2013. Dogecoins creators envisaged it as a fun, light-hearted cryptocurrency that would have greater appeal beyond the core Bitcoin audience, since it was based on a dog meme. Tesla CEO Elon Musk posted several tweets on social media that Dogecoin is his favorite coin.Dogecoin differs from Bitcoins proof-of-work protocol in several ways, one of which is by using Scrypt technology. The altcoin has also a block time of 1 minute, and the total supply is uncapped, which means that there is no limit to the number of Dogecoin that can be mined.You can mine Dogecoin either solo, or by joining a mining pool. A Doge miner can mine the digital currency on Windows, Mac or Linux, and with a GPU. As of 2014, you can also mine Litecoin in the same process of mining Dogecoin, as the processes were merged.Dogecoin has been used primarily as a tipping system on Reddit and Twitter to reward the creation or sharing of quality content. You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in a community that uses the digital currency, or you can get your Dogecoin from a Dogecoin faucet. A Dogecoin faucet is a website that will give you a small amount of Dogecoin for free as an introduction to the currency, so that you can begin interacting in Dogecoin communities.You can sell or buy Dogecoin at any exchange that offers the digital currency, store it on an exchange or in a Dogecoin wallet, and tip Dogecoin in any communities that accept Dogecoin.

                           :Coin ;
		:about " USD Coin (known by its ticker USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the U.S. dollar on a 1:1 basis. Every unit of this cryptocurrency in circulation is backed up by $1 that is held in reserve, in a mix of cash and short-term U.S. Treasury bonds. The Centre consortium, which is behind this asset, says USDC is issued by regulated financial institutions.The stablecoin originally launched on a limited basis in September 2018. Put simply, USD Coin’s mantra is “digital money for the digital age” — and the stablecoin is designed for a world where cashless transactions are becoming more common.Several use cases have been unveiled for the USD Coin. As well as providing a safe haven for crypto traders in times of volatility, those behind the stablecoin say it can also allow businesses to accept payments in digital assets, and shake up an array of sectors including decentralized finance and gaming.Overall, the goal is to create an ecosystem where USDC is accepted by as many wallets, exchanges, service providers and dApps as possible.The Centre Consortium has two founding members. One of them is the peer-to-peer payment services company Circle, while the other is the Coinbase cryptocurrency exchange. Other crypto ventures are open to join this consortium.Explaining the rationale behind USDC, Circle co-founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville wrote: “We believe that an open internet of value exchange can transform and integrate the world more deeply, eventually eliminating artificial economic borders and enabling a more efficient and inclusive global marketplace that connects every person on the planet.”In 2020, Circle and Coinbase collectively announced a major upgrade to USDC’s protocol and smart contract. The goal of these enhancements is to make it easier for USD Coin to be used for everyday payments, commerce and peer-to-peer transactions.The stablecoin market has become exceedingly crowded over recent years — but USD Coin has aimed to stand head and shoulders over competitors in several ways.One of them concerns transparency — and giving users the assurance that they will be able to withdraw 1 USDC and receive $1 in return without any issues. To this end, it says a major accounting firm is tasked with verifying the levels of cash that are held in reserve, and ensuring this matches up with the number of tokens in circulation.Unlike some crypto ventures, Circle and Coinbase have also achieved regulatory compliance — and this has helped pave the way for international expansion. Both projects are also well-funded, giving the stablecoin certainty.Related Pages:What is a stablecoin?Find out about USDT, one of USDC’s biggest competitorsDetailed definitions for stablecoins in the CoinMarketCap glossaryCoinMarketCap Blog: Insightful analysis and featuresIt’s a bit difficult to give an exact number here — as in theory, the number of USDC that can exist is limitless. New coins are created in line with demand, whenever someone wants to purchase one with their humble dollar.That said, there have been factors that have helped USD Coin enjoy an explosion in popularity over the years — especially in 2020. One of them is the sudden, sharp rise in the popularity of decentralized finance. USDC is a common sight on many DeFi protocols given how it serves as an onramp to the wider ecosystem.All of the USDCs in circulation are actually ERC-20 tokens, which can be found on the Ethereum blockchain. One of the biggest advantages here is how it can then be integrated with Ethereum-based applications. As we mentioned earlier, security and confidence in this stablecoin is delivered by proving that U.S. dollars are being held safely in reserve.As you might expect, one of the most enthusiastic exchanges that offers USDC is Coinbase, given how the exchange was involved in this stablecoin’s creation. USD Coin can also be purchased and traded on Poloniex, Binance, OKEx and Bitfinex, as well as decentralized exchanges such as Uniswap.USDC is commonly bought with Bitcoin — and if it’s your first time buying Bitcoin, be sure to check out our comprehensive guide here." ;

		:about "Uniswap is a popular decentralized trading protocol, known for its role in facilitating automated trading of decentralized finance (DeFi) tokens.An example of an automated market maker (AMM), Uniswap launched in November 2018, but has gained considerable popularity this year thanks to the DeFi phenomenon and associated surge in token trading.Uniswap aims to keep token trading automated and completely open to anyone who holds tokens, while improving the efficiency of trading versus that on traditional exchanges.Uniswap creates more efficiency by solving liquidity issues with automated solutions, avoiding the problems which plagued the first decentralized exchanges.In September 2020, Uniswap went a step further by creating and awarding its own governance token, UNI, to past users of the protocol. This added both profitability potential and the ability for users to shape its future — an attractive aspect of decentralized entities.Uniswap came about as a plan to introduce AMMs on Ethereum to a wider audience. The platform’s creator is Ethereum developer Hayden Adams.Adams worked in various projects while finalizing Uniswap, and his work was informed directly by Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. Buterin even ended up giving the protocol its name — it was originally known as Unipeg.Adams has also said that the original inspiration for the Uniswap platform came from one of Buterin’s own blog posts. His original idea to focus on Ethereum came after a friend convinced him to begin researching and understanding the protocol in 2017.Uniswap exists to create liquidity — and therefore trading and the value that trading provides — for the DeFi sphere.One of the major AMMs in operation at present, the protocol functions using a formula for automated exchange — X x Y = K. Founder Hayden Adams describes himself as the inventor of the particular implementation of the formula on Uniswap.Uniswap is not just a decentralized exchange it attempts to solve the issues that platforms such as EtherDelta experienced with liquidity. By automating the process of market making, the protocol inceventizes activity by limiting risk and reducing costs for all parties. The mechanism also removes identity requirements for users, and technically anyone can create a liquidity pool for any pair of tokens.According to Uniswap, their governance token (UNI) was created in order to “officially enshrin[e] Uniswap as publicly-owned and self-sustainable infrastructure while continuing to carefully protect its indestructible and autonomous qualities.”Learn more about Balancer here.Learn more about Curve here.New to DeFi and cryptocurrency? Check out our education resources here.Uniswap vs PancakeswapThe total supply of Uniswap’s governance token, UNI, is 1 billion units. These will become available over the course of four years, after which Uniswap will introduce a “perpetual inflation rate” of 2% to maintain network participation. Token distribution currently consists of the following: 60% to Uniswap community members, i.e. users, 21.51% to team members, 17.8% to investors and 0.69% to advisors. The latter three distributions will occur according to a four-year vesting schedule.Out of the majority set to go to users, 15% can be claimed by those who used Uniswap prior to Sep. 1, 2020. These even include users who submitted transactions which were never successful — they are eligible for 400 UNI.Uniswap is a decentralized protocol for trading, and UNI is its in-house governance token. UNI is an ERC-20 token, meaning it requires Ethereum to function. ERC-20 merely defines a set of rules for tokens, as well as security considerations mainly related to the strength of the Ethereum network. For example, congestion can hike the price of gas needed to perform transactions, leading to delays and abnormally high transaction fees, which impact all participants.Separately, smart contracts can cause security issues that could lead to DeFi traders losing funds in fact, hackers have already succeeded in stealing millions of dollars in DeFi’s short lifetime as of fall 2020.Uniswap’s UNI governance token is available for trading on major exchanges against other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins, fiat currencies and more. These include Binance, OKEx and Coinbase Pro, along with, naturally, Uniswap’s protocol itself.You can read more about how to enter the cryptocurrency market, no matter what token you plan to purchase, here." ;

		:about "Bitcoin Cash is a peer-to-peer electronic cash system that aims to become sound global money with fast payments, micro fees, privacy, and high transaction capacity (big blocks). In the same way that physical money, such as a dollar bill, is handed directly to the person being paid, Bitcoin Cash payments are sent directly from one person to another.As a permissionless, decentralized cryptocurrency, Bitcoin Cash requires no trusted third parties and no central bank. Unlike traditional fiat money, Bitcoin Cash does not depend on monetary middlemen such as banks and payment processors. Transactions cannot be censored by governments or other centralized corporations. Similarly, funds cannot be seized or frozen — because financial third parties have no control over the Bitcoin Cash network. Bitcoin Cash combines gold-like scarcity with the spendable nature of cash. With a limited total supply of 21 million coins, Bitcoin Cash is provably scarce and, like physical cash, can be easily spent. Transactions are fast with transaction fees typically less than a tenth of a cent. Anybody can accept Bitcoin Cash payments with a smartphone or computer.Bitcoin Cash has various use cases. In addition to peer-to-peer payments between individuals, Bitcoin Cash can be used to pay participating merchants for goods and services in-store and online. Very low fees enable new micro-transaction economies, such as tipping content creators and rewarding app users a few cents. Bitcoin Cash also reduces the fees and settlement times for remittances and cross-border trade. Other use cases include tokens, simplified smart contracts, and private payments with tools such as CashShuffle and CashFusion.In 2017, the Bitcoin project and its community split in two over concerns about Bitcoin’s scalability. The result was a hard fork which created Bitcoin Cash, a new cryptocurrency considered by supporters to be the legitimate continuation of the Bitcoin project as peer-to-peer electronic cash. All Bitcoin holders at the time of the fork (block 478,558) automatically became owners of Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin, which was invented by the pseudonymous Satoshi Nakomoto remains a separate cryptocurrency.Unlike Bitcoin BTC, Bitcoin Cash aims to scale so it can meet the demands of a global payment system. At the time of the split, the Bitcoin Cash block size was increased from 1MB to 8MB. An increased block size means Bitcoin Cash can now handle significantly more transactions per second (TPS) while keeping fees extremely low, solving the issues of payment delays and high fees experienced by some users on the Bitcoin BTC network. As of November 2020, Bitcoin Cash has a block size of 32MB.Mining is the process in which new Bitcoin Cash transactions are confirmed and new blocks are added to the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. Miners use computing power and electricity to solve complex puzzles. By doing so, they gain the ability to produce new blocks of transactions. If one of their blocks is accepted by the network, the miner, or mining pool, earns a block reward in the form of newly-issued Bitcoin Cash. Mining is highly competitive. As the price of Bitcoin Cash in the marketplace rises, more miners are incentivized to bring more hash rate into the ever-increasing miner competition to produce blocks and have them accepted by the Bitcoin Cash network. More miners make the network more secure by increasing and distributing the hash rate. This prevents a single miner from having control over the network. Anyone can mine Bitcoin Cash. Mining requires specialized hardware called mining equipment, which can either be bought or rented. Miners also need to run a full node software (with the majority of miners currently running BCHN) to build blocks and connect to the rest of the Bitcoin Cash network. Mining can be done independently but miners often pool their hash rate together and share proportionally in the earned block rewards. Bitcoin Cash is available at a variety of crypto exchanges, depending on your region. For the latest list of exchanges and trading pairs for this cryptocurrency, click on our market pairs tab. Be sure to do your own research before picking an exchange to buy Bitcoin Cash." ;

		:about "Litecoin (LTC) is a cryptocurrency that was designed to provide fast, secure and low-cost payments by leveraging the unique properties of blockchain technology. The cryptocurrency was created based on the Bitcoin (BTC) protocol, but it differs in terms of the hashing algorithm used, hard cap, block transaction times and a few other factors. Litecoin has a block time of just 2.5 minutes and extremely low transaction fees, making it suitable for micro-transactions and point-of-sale payments. Litecoin was released via an open-source client on GitHub on Oct. 7, 2011, and the Litecoin Network went live five days later on Oct. 13, 2011. Since then, it has exploded in both usage and acceptance among merchants and has counted among the top ten cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for most of its existence.The cryptocurrency was created by Charlie Lee, a former Google employee, who intended Litecoin to be a lite version of Bitcoin, in that it features many of the same properties as Bitcoin—albeit lighter in weight. As we previously touched on, Litecoin was founded by Charlie Lee, an early cryptocurrency adopter and a name held in high regard in the cryptocurrency industry. Charlie Lee, also known as “Chocobo,” is an early Bitcoin miner and computer scientist, who was a former software engineer for Google. In addition, Charlie Lee held the role of director of engineering at Coinbase between 2015 and 2017 before moving on to other ventures. Today, Charlie Lee is an outspoken advocate of cryptocurrencies and is the managing director of the Litecoin Foundation—a non-profit organization that works alongside the Litecoin Core Development team to help advance Litecoin. Besides Lee, the Litecoin Foundation also includes three other individuals on the board of directors: Xinxi Wang, Alan Austin and Zing Yang — all of which are accomplished in their own right. Behind Bitcoin, Litecoin is the second most popular pure cryptocurrency. This success can be largely attributed to its simplicity and clear utility benefits. As of January 2021, Litecoin is one of the most widely accepted cryptocurrencies, and more than 2,000 merchants and stores now accept LTC across the globe. Its main benefit comes from its speed and cost-effectiveness. Litecoin transactions are typically confirmed in just minutes, and transaction fees are nearly negligible. This makes it an attractive alternative to Bitcoin in developing countries, where transaction fees may be the deciding factor on which cryptocurrency to support. In late 2020, Litecoin also saw the release of the MimbleWimble (MW) testnet, which is used to test Mimblewimble-based confidential transactions on Litecoin. Once this feature is available on the mainnet, Litecoin users will also benefit from greatly enhanced privacy and fungibility. Check out Bitcoin (BTC) — the original cryptocurrency.Check out Nano (NANO) — another lightweight, fast cryptocurrency.Get up to date with the latest Litecoin updates and discussion.Subscribe to the CoinMarketCap blog for the latest cryptocurrency news and updates.Like most proof-of-work (POW) cryptocurrencies, the amount of Litecoin in circulation gradually increases with each newly mined block. As of January 2021, 66.245 million LTC have already been mined out of a total maximum supply of 84 million. The Litecoin Foundation recently estimated it will be well over 100 years until Litecoin reaches full dilution (around the year 2140) — since the number of LTC mined per block decreases every four years as part of the block reward halving schedule.Around 500,000 LTC was instamined on day one after the LTC genesis block was mined and Charlie Lee and presumably other early Litecoin developers were among the first miners. Despite this, as a fairly distributed asset, the Litecoin developers or Charlie Lee do not receive any direct profits from the operation of Litecoin—other than anything they may earn as part of the regular mining process. As a blockchain-based cryptocurrency, Litecoin is secured by incredibly strong cryptographic defenses — making it practically impossible to crack. Like Bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies, Litecoin uses the PoW consensus algorithm to ensure transactions are confirmed quickly and without errors. The combined strength of the Litecoin mining network prevents double-spends and a range of other attacks, while ensuring the network has 100% uptime. Litecoin is one of the few cryptocurrencies with a wide variety of fiat trading pairs, and can be exchanged for U.S. dollars (USD), Korean won (KRW), euros (EUR) and more when you buy Litecoin. Some of the most prominent names include Huobi Global, Binance, Coinbase Pro, OKEx and Kraken.

		:about "Solana is a highly functional open source project that banks on blockchain technology’s permissionless nature to provide decentralized finance (DeFi) solutions. While the idea and initial work on the project began in 2017, Solana was officially launched in March 2020 by the Solana Foundation with headquarters in Geneva, Switzerland. The Solana protocol is designed to facilitate decentralized app (DApp) creation. It aims to improve scalability by introducing a proof-of-history (PoH) consensus combined with the underlying proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus of the blockchain. Because of the innovative hybrid consensus model, Solana enjoys interest from small-time traders and institutional traders alike. A significant focus for the Solana Foundation is to make decentralized finance accessible on a larger scale. Anatoly Yakovenko is the most important person behind Solana. His professional career started at Qualcomm, where he quickly moved up the ranks and became senior staff engineer manager in 2015. Later on, his professional path shifted, and Yakovenko entered a new position as a software engineer at Dropbox. In 2017, Yakovenko started working on a project which would later materialize as Solana. He teamed up with his Qualcomm colleague Greg Fitzgerald, and they founded a project called Solana Labs. Attracting several more former Qualcomm colleagues in the process, the Solana protocol and SOL token were released to the public in 2020.One of the essential innovations Solana brings to the table is the proof-of-history (PoH) consensus developed by Anatoly Yakovenko. This concept allows for greater scalability of the protocol, which in turn boosts usability. Solana is known in the cryptocurrency space because of the incredibly short processing times the blockchain offers. Solana’s hybrid protocol allows for significantly decreased validation times for both transaction and smart contract execution. With lightning-fast processing times, Solana has attracted a lot of institutional interest as well.The Solana protocol is intended to serve both small-time users and enterprise customers alike. One of Solana’s main promises to customers is that they will not be surprised by increased fees and taxes. The protocol is designed in such a way as to have low transaction costs while still guaranteeing scalability and fast processing. Combined with the longstanding professional expertise creators Anatoly Yakovenko and Greg Fitzgerald bring to the project, Solana is ranked number 42 in the CoinMarketCap ranking as of February 2021. Read more about Steem.Check out Marlin.Learn more about Decentralized Finance (DeFi).Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.The Solana Foundation has announced that a total of 489 million SOL tokens will be released in circulation. At the moment, about 260 million of these have already entered the market. The SOL token distribution is as follows: 16.23% went towards an initial seed sale, 12.92% of tokens were dedicated to a founding sale, 12.79% of SOL coins were distributed among team members and 10.46% of tokens were given to the Solana Foundation. The remaining tokens were already released for public and private sales or are still to be released to the market. Solana relies on a unique combination of proof-of-history (PoH) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. Proof-of-history is the main component of the Solana protocol, as it is responsible for the bulk of transaction processing. PoH records successful operations and the time that has passed between them, thus ensuring the trustless nature of the blockchain. The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is used as a monitoring tool for the PoH processes, and it validates each sequence of blocks produced by it. The combination of two consensus mechanisms makes Solana a unique phenomenon in the blockchain industry. SOL tokens can be purchased on most exchanges. One choice to trade Solana is on Binance, as it has the highest SOL/USDT trading volume, $8,947,213 as of February 2021.Next is OKEx, with a trading volume of $6,180,82. Other options to trade Solana include Bilaxy and Huobi Global. Of course, it is important to note that investing in cryptocurrency comes with a risk, just like any other investment opportunity." ;

		:about "Founded in 2017, Chainlink is a blockchain abstraction layer that enables universally connected smart contracts. Through a decentralized oracle network, Chainlink allows blockchains to securely interact with external data feeds, events and payment methods, providing the critical off-chain information needed by complex smart contracts to become the dominant form of digital agreement.The Chainlink Network is driven by a large open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers, security auditors and more. The company focuses on ensuring that decentralized participation is guaranteed for all node operators and users looking to contribute to the network. Sergey Nazarov is a co-founder and CEO at Chainlink Labs. He graduated with a degree in business administration from New York University, with a focus on philosophy and administration. His professional career began as a teaching fellow at NYU Stern School of Business. In 2009, Nazarov co-founded ExistLocal, a peer-to-peer marketplace for authentic local experiences. In 2014, he also co-founded CryptaMail, a completely decentralized, blockchain-based email service. In 2014, Nazarov teamed up with Steve Ellis and launched SmartContract, a platform that brings smart contracts to life by connecting them to external data and widely accepted bank payments. SmartContract was one of the entrepreneurial ventures that led Sergey Nazarov to the founding of Chainlink. Steve Ellis graduated with a degree in computer science from New York University in 2010. Right after graduating, he became a software engineer at Pivotal Labs. In 2014, he co-founded the Secure Asset Exchange, a company facilitating easy web access to a decentralized asset exchange.Chainlink is one of the first networks to allow the integration of off-chain data into smart contracts. With many trusted partners, Chainlink is one of the major players in the data processing field. Due to the integration of off-chain data, Chainlink has attracted the attention of numerous trusted data providers, including Brave New Coin, Alpha Vantage and Huobi. Data providers can sell access to data directly to Chainlink, thus monetizing the information they have. As a decentralized network, Chainlink allows users to become node operators and earn revenue by running critical data infrastructure required for blockchains’ success. Chainlink uses a large collection of node operators to collectively power a wide range of decentralized Price Feed oracle networks live in-production, which currently secure billions in value for leading DeFi applications like Synthetix, Aave, yEarn and more.Read more about OctoFi.Find out more about Benchmark Protocol.Learn more about Decentralized Data Governance.Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.During the initial coin offering (ICO) for LINK, Chainlink announced a total and maximum supply of 1,000,000,000 LINK tokens. The current supply is about 419,009,556 LINK tokens, or about 42% of the total supply.According to the ICO documentation, 35% of the total token supply will go towards node operators and the incentivization of the ecosystem. Another 35% of LINK tokens were distributed during public sale events. Lastly, the remaining 30% of the total token supply was directed towards the company for the continued development of the Chainlink ecosystem and network. As an Ethereum-based ERC-20 token, Chainlink is secured by the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanism. Unlike the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus utilized by Bitocin, PoS relies on the amount of staked tokens for selecting node validators.PoS protocols were created with the idea to battle the vast power consumption required by PoW systems. PoS models are becoming increasingly popular as they need less electrical power and are easily scalable. While PoW has proven itself a reliable consensus mechanism, Ethereum and all other ERC-20 tokens have been growing rapidly and setting the trend in the space. Chainlink and the LINK token are among the most popular cryptocurrencies on the market. Considering this, a lot of exchanges have pushed to start offering trades in LINK. One top exchange to buy Chainlink is Binance.Other exchanges offering trades in LINK include:It is important to consider the fact that investing in cryptocurrency carries risk, just like any other investment.

		:about "Theta (THETA) is a blockchain powered network purpose-built for video streaming. Launched in March 2019, the Theta mainnet operates as a decentralized network in which users share bandwidth and computing resources on a peer-to-peer (P2P) basis.The project is advised by Steve Chen, co-founder of YouTube and Justin Kan, co-founder of Twitch.Theta features its own native cryptocurrency token, THETA, which performs various governance tasks within the network, and counts Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi, Sony Europe and Samsung as Enterprise validators, along with a Guardian network of thousands of community-run guardian nodes.Developers say that the project aims to shake up the video streaming industry in its current form — centralization, poor infrastructure and high costs mean that end users often end up with a poor experience. Content creators likewise earn less revenue due to the barriers between them and end users.Theta was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2018. Liu has a long history in the gaming and video industries, co-founding video advertising firm Tapjoy, mobile social gaming startup Gameview Studios, and THETA.tv, the live streaming platform whose DApp was the first to be built on the Theta protocol.Long is Theta’s second co-founder and CTO, following similar multi-year experience in design automation, gaming, virtual reality, and large scale distributed systems. He authored multiple peer-reviewed academic papers and holds various patents in video streaming, blockchain and virtual reality.Theta now has a modest team, and its official website lists strategic corporate investors as Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, media investors BDMI Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, CAA Creative Artists Agency, and traditional Silicon Valley VCs including DCM, Sierra Ventures and the VR Fund.Theta’s main business concept is to decentralize video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants.The network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA), Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.Theta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising and subscription revenues.Users have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems.In addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) on its fully featured EVM-compatible Smart contract platform.Find out more about Livepeer here.Find out more about LBRY here.Crypto newbie? Find the answers to all your questions with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.Theta involves two tokens: THETA and TFUEL. THETA exists only for governance purposes, with 5 TFUEL tokens issued per 1 THETA held at the time of the mainnet launch in 2019.THETA itself launched in 2018, at which time it was distributed to buyers as an ERC-20 token on Ethereum. Afterwards, all ERC-20 THETA were converted to native THETA on the mainnet.The total supply of THETA is capped at 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens. It is distributed in various proportions among all network participants, as well as the Theta team itself and a reserve pool.TFUEL is used to power transactions in a similar way to gas on Ethereum (ETH). Its total supply is 5 billion (5,000,000,000) tokens.Theta uses a financial incentive scheme to ensure user participation in governance activities, and hence its network is secured by its own users.The network relies on proof-of-stake (PoS), and employs a multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism to balance security with high transaction throughput.With the launch of Guardian nodes in June 2019, Theta ensured that no single entity controls the majority of THETA tokens being staked at any one time.THETA, as the main token for the Theta platform, is freely tradable on major exchanges. Pairs include cryptocurrencies, fiat currencies and stablecoins. As of October 2020, the highest volume pairs come from Binance, with the most popular trading currency being stablecoin Tether (USDT).New to crypto?

		:about "Wrapped Bitcoin is a tokenized version of Bitcoin (BTC) that runs on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain.WBTC is compliant with ERC-20 — the basic compatibility standard of the Ethereum blockchain — allowing it to be fully integrated into the latter’s ecosystem of decentralized exchanges, crypto lending services, prediction markets and other ERC-20-enabled decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.WBTC is also backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio via a network of automatically monitored merchants and custodians, ensuring that its price is pegged to Bitcoin at all times and allows users to transfer liquidity between the BTC and the ETH networks in a decentralized and autonomous manner.Wrapped Bitcoin was first announced on October 26, 2018, and officially launched on January 31, 2019.The Wrapped Tokens project, of which WBTC is a part, wasn’t founded by individuals but is rather a joint project of three organizations: BitGo, Kyber Network and Ren.BitGo, co-founded in 2013 by American computer scientist and entrepreneur Mike Belshe, is an institutional digital asset custody, trading and financial services firm. In addition to being one of the developers of WBTC, BitGo also serves as its original custodian — the entity that holds WBTC tokens and the keys needed to mint more of them.Kyber Network is an on-blockchain liquidity protocol that enables the integration of different cryptocurrency tokens and DeFi applications. It was founded in 2017 by Loi Luu, Victor Tran and Yaron Velner and is based in Singapore. Along with Ren, Kyber Network has helped create WBTC and still serves as a merchant on its network — the institution that mints and burns WBTC tokens to maintain the 1:1 ratio of tokens to BTC reserves.Similarly to Kyber, Ren is a company focused on cross-blockchain integration of cryptocurrency assets and DeFi applications via solutions such as RenBridge, RenVM and others. It was founded in 2017 by Taiyang Zhang and Loong Wang.By virtue of being the oldest and largest cryptocurrency on the market, Bitcoin can boast a massive user base and a liquidity pool of several dozen billion dollars. However, its blockchain functionality is relatively basic by modern standards.Unlike Bitcoin, Ethereum was built from the ground up to support more advanced use cases by utilizing the technology of smart contracts, giving rise to an entire industry dubbed “decentralized finance.” Ethereum and products derived from it offer their users such advanced financial instruments as lending and insurance, which do not rely on trusted intermediaries.By “wrapping” BTC in the ERC-20 standard, WBTC enables full integration of a Bitcoin-like asset into this advanced environment of financial decentralized applications, bringing along the immense liquidity associated with the BTC market.In addition, Wrapped Bitcoin makes the job significantly easier for exchanges, wallets and payment services that work with Ethereum: instead of having to run two separate nodes for ETH and BTC networks, they can support WBTC operations with just an Ethereum node.Finally, Ethereum blockchain’s faster average blocktime — about 15 seconds vs 10 minutes respectively — increases the speed with which WBTC can be transacted, compared to actual bitcoins.Learn more about other Bitcoin-pegged tokens on the Ethereum network, like renBTC and HBTC.Check out our educational deep dive into how Ren is bringing Bitcoin to DeFi.CMC Alexandria has a basic into to Wrapped Bitcoin right here.There is no predetermined schedule of WBTC issuance. Instead, WBTC is automatically minted or burned whenever users purchase or sell their tokens for Bitcoin via a system of merchants and custodians.Because Wrapped Bitcoin is always backed by Bitcoin at a 1:1 ratio, the number of tokens in circulation is directly dependent on the amount of Bitcoin reserves in the WBTC network. As of October 2020, that number was just over 94,000 tokens, worth approximately $1 billion in total.WBTC tokens are secured by the parent blockchain they run on — Ethereum. In turn, ETH is protected by the Ethash proof-of-work function, a representative of the Keccak family of hash functions.You can buy WBTC on several exchanges, both centralized and decentralized ones, which serve as merchants on the Wrapped Bitcoin network.

		:about "Put simply, Stellar is an open network that allows money to be moved and stored. When it was released in July 2014, one of its goals was boosting financial inclusion by reaching the world’s unbanked — but soon afterwards, its priorities shifted to helping financial firms connect with one another through blockchain technology.The network’s native token, lumens, serves as a bridge that makes it less expensive to trade assets across borders. All of this aims to challenge existing payment providers, who often charge high fees for a similar service.If all of this sounds familiar, it is worth noting that Stellar was originally based on the Ripple Labs protocol. The blockchain was created as a result of hard fork, and the code was subsequently rewritten.Jed McCaleb founded Stellar with the lawyer Joyce Kim after leaving Ripple in 2013 over disagreements about the company’s future direction.In explaining the rationale behind Stellar in September 2020, McCaleb told CoinMarketCap: “The whole original design of Stellar is that you can have fiat currencies and other kinds of forms of value run in parallel with each other and with crypto assets. This is super important to drive this stuff mainstream.”McCaleb’s goal is to ensure that Stellar can give people a way of moving their fiat into crypto — and eliminate the friction that people normally experience when they are sending money around the world.He currently serves as the CTO of Stellar, as well as the co-founder of the Stellar Development Foundation. This not-for-profit organization aims to “unlock the world’s economic potential by making money more fluid, markets more open, and people more empowered.”Fees are a sticking point for many. However, high costs when making cross-border payments aren’t just exclusive to fiat-based payments solutions such as PayPal — transaction fees have also been known to go through the roof on the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains because of congestion.Stellar is unique because every transaction costs just 0.00001 XLM. Given how one unit of this cryptocurrency only costs a few cents at the time of writing, this helps ensure that users keep more of their money.Few blockchain projects have managed to secure partnerships with big-brand technology companies and fintech firms. A few years ago, Stellar and IBM teamed up to launch World Wire, a project that allowed large financial institutions to submit transactions to the Stellar network and transact using bridge assets such as stablecoins.Although other blockchains have community funds, meaning that grants can be given to projects that help further the ecosystem, Stellar allows its users to vote on which ventures should be given this support.Find out more about XRP, the cryptocurrency XLM forked fromRead the Crypto Titans interview with Stellar’s Jed McCalebCMC Alexandria: The best educational resource for cryptoPlenty more interviews on the CoinMarketCap BlogA total of 100 billion XLM were issued when the Stellar network launched in 2015 — but things have changed since the release date. At present, the total supply stands at 50 billion XLM, and the circulating supply is currently 20.7 billion.In 2019, the Stellar Development Foundation announced that it was burning over half of the cryptocurrency’s supply. This means that it now controls approximately 30 billion XLM. While some of this capital is earmarked for marketing and helping the organization develop, about one third is reserved for making investments in other blockchain ventures.Explaining why it took this drastic move — and promising not to burn any more XLM in the future — the foundation explained: “SDF can be leaner and do the work it was created to do using fewer lumens… Those 55.5 billion lumens weren’t going to increase the adoption of Stellar.”This network is secured using the Stellar Consensus Protocol, which is described as having four main properties: “Decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.”Through SCP, anyone is able to join the process of achieving consensus, and no single entity can end up with the majority of decision-making power. Transactions are also confirmed cheaply and within a few seconds — and safeguards are in place if bad actors attempt to join the network.It is possible to buy Stellar from a wide range of top exchanges - including Binance, Coinbase, Kraken, Bittrex, Bitfinex, Upbit and Huobi. It’s also common to convert fiat into Bitcoin before purchasing altcoins, and you can find out more about how this is done with our guide." ;

		:about "VeChain (VET) is a blockchain-powered supply chain platform. Begun in 2015 and launched in June 2016, VeChain aims to use distributed governance and Internet of Things (IoT) technology to create an ecosystem which solves some of the major problems with supply chain management.The platform uses two in-house tokens, VET and VTHO, to manage and create value based on its VeChainThor public blockchain.The idea is to boost the efficiency, traceability and transparency of supply chains while reducing costs and placing more control in the hands of individual users.VeChain is the product of creator and co-founder Sunny Lu, an IT executive who was formerly CIO of Louis Vuitton China. Lu has since become a well-known name within the cryptocurrency industry. He has drawn attention to the ability of blockchain technology to solve transparency in particular, arguing that it can create “trust-free” structures which do not suffer from corruption as part of the supply chain.Fellow co-founder Jay Zhang, who directs VeChains global corporate structure, governance, and financial management, previously worked for both Deloitte and PriceWaterhouseCoopers in the finance and risk management sphere. Having launched in June 2016, VeChain is one of the oldest dedicated blockchain supply chain platforms on the market.VeChain exists to disrupt traditional supply chain models, an industry which before blockchain had remained little changed over the decades.Using transparent technology with no single point of weakness or control allows for greater security, efficiency and ease of tracking products in a given supply chain, while reducing cost through trustless automation.VeChain’s model thus appeals to businesses looking to reduce supply chain friction and give a more transparent impression to clients.VeChain’s official literature notes that its unique proposition lies in its dual-token setup, among other features. In-house token fees combine with charges for various services to generate operating income for the company, while token holders can engage in activities such as staking, thus providing liquidity in return for rewards.Read more about Orchid here.Read more about PIVX here.New to cryptocurrency? Check out Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education suite.VeChain has two in-house tokens: VeChain (VET) and VeThor (VTHO). Described as a unique offering for such a platform, the dual-token system is designed to avoid fee fluctuations and network congestion.VET is the token used for transactions and other activities, while VTHO provides fee payments and thus functions as a “gas token,” similar to how gas functions for Ethereum (ETH) transactions.VET holders automatically generate a small amount of passive income in VTHO, while 70% of the VTHO used in a VET payment is destroyed. VTHO is generated based on VET holdings, while VET itself has a maximum fixed supply of 86,712,634,466 tokens. VeChain (VET) is a proof-of-stake token, and VeChain itself explains that relatively low computing power is required to achieve network security and maintain user consensus. A separate feature, proof-of-authority, involves authority masternode operators maintaining the protocol in their own interest according to rules laid down by parent organization, the VeChain Foundation.VET is a freely-tradable token available on major exchanges, while markets also exist for VTHO.VET had major markets on Binance and Huobi Global among other platforms, with pairs for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies.If you’re new to cryptocurrency and want to know how to buy Bitcoin (BTC) or any other token, you can read more here." ;

		:about "The Internet Computer is the world’s first blockchain that runs at web speed with unbounded capacity. It also represents the third major blockchain innovation, alongside Bitcoin and Ethereum — a blockchain computer that scales smart contract computation and data, runs them at web speed, processes and stores data efficiently, and provides powerful software frameworks to developers. By making this possible, the Internet Computer enables the complete reimagination of software — providing a revolutionary new way to build tokenized internet services, pan-industry platforms, decentralized financial systems, and even traditional enterprise systems and websites.The project was founded in October 2016 by Dominic Williams, and attracted notable interest from the crypto community. DFINITY raised a total of $121 million from contributors such as Andreessen Horowitz, Polychain Capital, SV Angel, Aspect Ventures, Electric Capital, ZeroEx, Scalar Capital, and Multicoin Capital, and several notable early Ethereum supporters. In 2018, over 50,000 registerter participants received ICP utility tokens in an airdrop. On December 18, 2020, DFINITY launched the alpha mainnet of the Internet Computer. In a final step towards decentralization, on May 10, 2021, DFINITY launched the Internet Computer into the public domain. This major milestone means that the internet now functions as a decentralized global computer — marked by the release of all of the Internet Computer’s source code into the public domain, as well as ICP utility token allowing tens of thousands of community members to govern the Internet Computer network.Dominic Williams is the Founder and Chief Scientist of DFINITY. He is a crypto theoretician, responsible for inventing Threshold Relay, Probabilistic Slot Consensus, and other novel crypto techniques, serial entrepreneur, and early member of the Bitcoin and Ethereum technical communities. Previously, he was President and CTO of String Labs, an incubator for venture-backed crypto projects, early pioneer of DeFi at Mirror Labs, and Founder and CEO of Fight My Monster, a MMO game for children that scaled to millions of users. He also founded several startups such as System7, Airdocs and Smartdrivez. Graduated King’s College London 1st in Class in Computer Science.The Internet Computer was incubated and launched by the DFINITY Foundation, a not-for profit scientific research organization based in Zurich, Switzerland, comprised of the world’s top cryptographers and distributed systems and programming language experts, with nearly 100,000 academic citations and 200 patents collectively. Notable technologists at DFINITY include:* Jan Camenisch, PhD (VP of Research) - world-renowned cryptographer & privacy researcher, led IBM’s Cryptography / Research department for 19 years* Andreas Rossberg, PhD (Principal Engineer and Researcher) - the co-creator of WebAssembly and former team lead for the Google Chrome V8 engine* Ben Lynn, PhD (Sr Staff Engineer and Researcher) - world-renowned cryptographer and Google Engineer, the “L” in BLS cryptography, the key signature system being used in Ethereum 2.0* Jens Groth, PhD (Principal Researcher) - world-renowned cryptographer, known for pioneering non-interactive zero knowledge proofs* Timo Hanke, PhD (Principal Researcher) - creator of AsicBoost, one of the few proven algorithmic optimizations for Bitcoin mining* Paul Liu, PhD (Staff Engineer) - architected Intel’s Haskell compiler and received his PhD under Paul Hudak, a key designer of Haskell* Johan Georg Granström, PhD (Director of Engineering) - former Sr Staff Software Engineer at Google responsible for scaling YouTube system infrastructureAfter public launch on May 10, 2021, the DFINITY Foundation will now be one of many organizations committed to improving and maintaining the Internet Computer network.The purpose of the Internet Computer is to extend the public internet, so it can also be the world’s compute platform. Today, the internet is a network that connects everybody and everything, but systems and services currently run from private infrastructure.The scientific breakthrough behind the Internet Computer is Chain Key Technology, which encompasses dozens of advanced technology such as novel Consensus, Non-Interactive Distributed Key Generation (NI-DKG), Network Nervous System (NNS), Internet Identity, etc.Chain Key Technology consists of a set of cryptographic protocols that orchestrate the nodes that make up the Internet Computer. It is one of the fundamental breakthroughs behind the Internet Computer, enabling it to have a single public key. This is a huge advantage because it allows any device, including smart watches and mobile phones, to verify the authenticity of artifacts from the Internet Computer. In contrast, this is not possible for traditional blockchains.The single public key is just the tip of the iceberg: Chain Key Technology is the engine that drives the Internet Computer and makes its operation possible. It allows for adding new nodes to form new subnets to scale the network infinitely replacing faulty or crashed nodes with new ones without ever stopping reviving subnets even if too many nodes within have failed and upgrading the Internet Computer Protocol seamlessly, allowing the network to fix bugs and add new features.The DFINITY R&D team has invented a new noninteractive key resharing protocol. Each of the old signers only needs to broadcast a single message to the new signers. To ensure that this is done securely, many concepts from advanced cryptography are utilized, including encryption with forward secrecy and noninteractive zero-knowledge proofs. Because it is noninteractive, the way the key resharing protocol operates is ideal for an asynchronous environment, and the benefits include key preservation. Throughout the lifetime of a subnet, it is known by a single public key, and the other parties on the Internet Computer do not have to keep track of changing public keys.At Genesis on May 10, 2021, the Internet Computer is supported by 48 independent data centers — located across North America, Europe, and Asia — running 1,300 nodes. The network will continue to grow exponentially to support the next generation of mega dapps, with 123 data centers running 4,300 nodes scheduled by the end of the year, and eventually thousands of data centers running millions of nodes to support the decade-long building out of the Open Internet.Importantly, anyone can become a node provider, interested parties apply for a Data Center ID (DCID) to the Network Nervous System (NNS), procure specialized machine nodes, install the ICP protocol, and connects to the Internet Computer network.The scientific breakthrough called Chain Key Technology allows the Internet Computer to run at web speed — where query calls execute in milliseconds, and update calls take 1-2 seconds to finalize. More importantly, at Genesis, the Internet Computer will have a block rate of 2.5 blocks per second (bps), then quickly to an industry leading bps of 10.3 bps, and ~1,000 bps by end of the year.In the case of an open version of Reddit running on the Internet Computer, when a user browses the forum, customized views of the hosted content would be formulated and served into their web browser by the execution of query calls, which run in milliseconds on a nearby node, providing a fantastic user experience. But when a user wishes to occasionally make a post, or provide a tip of tokens to the author of a post, this would involve update calls, which would take 1–2 seconds.ICP are native utility tokens that play three key roles in the network:Cycles power computation in the role of fuel. They also have a constant value over the long-term, which contrasts with ICP, whose value will naturally vary over time. Moreover, Cycles will be pegged to the SDR, which is a logical currency unit defined by the International Monetary Fund, and 1 SDR worth of ICP can be converted into exactly one trillion Cycles to power computation.A neuron locks a balance of ICP utility tokens and enables its owner to participate in network governance, through which they can earn voting rewards.There will be 469,213,710 ICP tokens at Genesis.Circulating supply depends on the dynamics of the market. However, it is approximated to be 26% at Genesis.Genesis Initial State Token AllocationsThe NNS works by receiving proposals and deciding to adopt or reject them based on voting activity by neurons that network participants have created. Neurons are also used by participants to submit new proposals. After submission, proposals are either adopted or rejected, which can happen almost immediately or after some delay, depending on how the totality of neurons vote.Coinbase, Huobi and OKEx have announced they will list Internet Computer utility tokens (ICP) when the Internet Computer launches on May 10 at 9AM PT / May 11 12AM China Time. The Internet Computer launched with several high profile entrepreneurs and applications being built on it. These include:" ;

		:about "Ethereum Classic (ETC) is a hard fork of Ethereum (ETH) that launched in July 2016. Its main function is as a smart contract network, with the ability to host and support decentralized applications (DApps). Its native token is ETC.Since its launch, Ethereum Classic has sought to differentiate itself from Ethereum, with the two networks’ technical roadmap diverging further and further from each other with time.Ethereum Classic first set out to preserve the integrity of the existing Ethereum blockchain after a major hacking event led to the theft of 3.6 million ETH.Ethereum Classic is in fact the legacy chain of Ethereum, and its true creators are therefore the original Ethereum developers — Vitalik Buterin and Gavin Wood.A contentious hard fork on Ethereum occurred in July 2016, when participants disagreed over whether to revert the blockchain to cancel out the effects of a major hack. This impacted The DAO, a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) which had raised approximately $150 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) several months earlier.Ethereum Classic came into being as the network which did not revert the chain. Developers state that there is no “official” team attached to the project, and that its “global development community is a permissionless do-ocracy, where anyone can participate.” Ethereum Classic’s main aim is to preserve the Ethereum blockchain as it originally was, without artificially countering the DAO hack.Its appeal was first to those who disagreed with Ethereum’s response, but the legacy network has since gained a wider fan base, which include major investors such as Barry Silbert, CEO of investment firm Grayscale. As a voluntary organization, the developers of ETC do not aim to turn the network into a for-profit entity. Users pay transaction fees as with Ethereum, and miners collect them based on work done as per the proof-of-work (PoW) mining algorithm.Unlike Ethereum, Ethereum Classic has no plans to convert to a proof-of-stake (PoS) mining algorithm, while multiple developers continue to work on future improvements such as scaling solutions. Read more about Ethereum here.Read more about Bitcoin Cash here.New to cryptocurrency? Find all the information you need with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource. ETC began in a very similar technical state to ETH, with the exception of how the DAO hack transactions were handled.Since launch, however, changes in tokenomics have occurred, with participants voting to cap the supply of ETC in December 2017. The maximum supply is thus 210,700,000 ETC, roughly ten times that of Bitcoin (BTC), while ETH has no cap.ETC uses a PoW mining algorithm, which functions like Bitcoin — miners are rewarded with new coins for validating the blockchain in competition with each other. The ETC block reward decreases with time, with the next drop due at block 15,000,000, roughly in April 2022 — from 3.2 ETC to 2.56 ETC per block.The Ethereum Classic network is secured using proof-of-work, but as a minority chain, it has suffered regular attacks itself.These include several 51% attacks to gain control of mining hashrate and execute spurious transactions and double spend coins, the most recent of which occurred in August 2020.ETC is a major market cap cryptocurrency and is freely tradable on a large number of major exchanges. Pairs are available against stablecoins, other cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies, while derivatives and institutional investment vehicles also exist.

		:about "Filecoin is a decentralized storage system that aims to “store humanity’s most important information.” The project raised $205 million in an initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, and initially planned a launch date for mid-2019. However, the launch date for the Filecoin mainnet was pushed back until block 148,888, which is expected in mid-October 2020.The project was first described back in 2014 as an incentive layer for the Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a peer-to-peer storage network. Filecoin is open protocol and backed by a blockchain that records commitments made by the network’s participants, with transactions made using FIL, the blockchain’s native currency. The blockchain is based on both proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime.Filecoin was founded by Juan Benet, who also created the Interplanetary File System. Benet is an American computer scientist who studied at Stanford University. After founding Protocol Labs in May 2014, he attended Y Combinator in the summer of 2014 with the intention of supporting both IPFS and Filecoin, as well as other projects.Filecoin aims to store data in a decentralized manner. Unlike cloud storage companies like Amazon Web Services or Cloudflare, which are prone to the problems of centralization, Filecoin leverages its decentralized nature to protect the integrity of a data’s location, making it easily retrievable and hard to censor. Decentralized storage systems like Filecoin allow people to be their own custodians of their data, as well as makes the web more accessible to people worldwide. Since participating in the Filecoin network by mining and storing is directly related to winning more block rewards, Filecoin incentives participants to act honestly and store as much data as possibleCheck out CMC Alexandria’ deep dive into Filecoin.We’ve also prepared a list of the 5 things that decentralized storage aims to fix.See terms you don’t know? Check out our glossary on Alexandria.Protocol Labs describes Filecoin’s tokenomics, or economic model, as a “market for data” where users can sell their storage space to other users, who are looking to rent. Five stakeholders will be able to trade tokens: developers, clients, miners, token holders and ecosystem partners. There will also be three Filecoin markets, according to Protocol Labs: file storage, file retrieval and on-exchange token trading. In fall 2020, 400 miners participated in what was called the “Space Race” testnet phase, increasing Filecoin’s network data capacity by over 325 pebibytes approximately 3.5 million FIL tokens will be released to the Space Race participants.Filecoin is secured through proof-of-replication and proof-of-spacetime. In the Filecoin network, nodes that are also known as retrieval miners are in competition to serve clients with data as quickly as they can. They are then rewarded with FIL fees, which encourages a network of nodes that want to replicate and preserve files. Storage miner nodes are constantly competing for contracts to provide storage to clients to a specific length of time. When a storage miner and their client agree on a deal, the storage miner holds the client’s data in a sector and “seals” it to create a unique copy of that sector’s data. Storage miners are rewarded with FIL by clients as deal fees, and these miners can also mine blocks and receive a block reward.Ahead of the Filecoin mainnet launch, Gemini and Kraken have announced support for FIL. Huobi will list FIL after the mainnet goes live.For more information about buying crypto, see CoinMarketCap’s easy guide here." ;

		:about "TRON is a blockchain-based operating system that aims to ensure this technology is suitable for daily use. Whereas Bitcoin can handle up to six transactions per second, and Ethereum up to 25, TRON claims that its network has capacity for 2,000 TPS.This project is best described as a decentralized platform focused on content sharing and entertainment — and to this end, one of its biggest acquisitions was the file sharing service BitTorrent back in 2018.Overall, TRON has divided its goals into six phases. These include delivering simple distributed file sharing, driving content creation through financial rewards, allowing content creators to launch their own personal tokens and decentralizing the gaming industry.TRON is also one of the most popular blockchains for building DApps.TRON was founded by Justin Sun, who now serves as CEO. Educated at Peking University and the University of Pennsylvania, he was recognized by Forbes Asia in its 30 Under 30 series for entrepreneurs.Born in 1990, he was also associated with Ripple in the past — serving as its chief representative in the Greater China area.TRON has positioned itself as an environment where content creators can connect with their audiences directly. By eliminating centralized platforms — whether they are streaming services, app stores or music sites — it is hoped that creators won’t end up losing as much commission to middlemen. In turn, this could also make content less expensive for consumers. Given how the entertainment sector is increasingly becoming digitized, TRON could have a headstart in applying blockchain technology to this industry.The company also says that it has a talented and experienced developer team, based around the world, that has been drawn from major companies such as Ripple Labs.Last but not least, whereas some other blockchain projects can be opaque about their plans for development, TRON offers a point of difference by delivering a roadmap that shows its intentions for the coming years.Find out about BitTorrent Token (BTT)Nine things to know before investing in cryptocurrencyLearn about cryptocurrency with CMC AlexandriaRead the latest posts on the CoinMarketCap blogWhat Is A Crypto Faucet?TRON has a total supply of just over 100 billion tokens — and at the time of writing, about 71.6 billion of these are in circulation.When a token sale was held in 2017, 15.75 billion TRX was allocated to private investors, while an additional 40 billion were earmarked for initial coin offering participants. The Tron Foundation was given 34 billion, and a company owned by Justin Sun got 10 billion.All in all, this meant that 45% of TRX supply went to the founder and the project itself, while 55% was distributed among investors. Critics argue that this is a much higher ratio than what has been seen with other cryptocurrency projects.TRON uses a consensus mechanism that is known as delegated proof-of-stake.TRX owners can freeze their cryptocurrency in order to get Tron Power, which means that they can vote for “super representatives” who serve as block producers.These block producers receive TRX rewards in exchange for verifying transactions, and these rewards are then distributed among the people who voted for them.According to TRON, this approach helps its blockchain to achieve higher levels of throughput. It is possible to buy Tron from dozens of the exchanges it is listed on - including Poloniex, Bancor, KuCoin, Binance, Bitfinex, Coinbene and others. However, it is not supported by Coinbase.Learn about converting your fiat to Bitcoin here — the perfect gateway to purchasing altcoins." ;

		:about "Monero was launched in 2014, and its goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography.The team behind Monero say privacy and security are their biggest priorities, with ease of use and efficiency coming second. It aims to provide protection to all users — irrespective of how technologically competent they are.Overall, XMR aims to allow payments to be made quickly and inexpensively without fear of censorship.Seven developers were initially involved in creating Monero — five of whom decided to remain anonymous. There have been rumors that XMR was also invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, the inventor of Bitcoin.XMR’s origins can be traced back to Bytecoin, a privacy-focused and decentralized cryptocurrency that was launched in 2012. Two years later, a member of the Bitcointalk forum — only known as thankfulfortoday — forked BCN’s codebase, and Monero was born. They had suggested “controversial changes” to Bytecoin that others in the community disagreed with and decided to take matters into their own hands.It’s believed that hundreds of developers have contributed to XMR over the years.There are several things that make Monero unique. One of the project’s biggest aims is achieving the greatest level of decentralization possible, meaning that a user doesn’t need to trust anyone else on the network.Privacy is achieved through a few distinctive features. Whereas each Bitcoin in circulation has its own serial number, meaning that cryptocurrency usage can be monitored, XMR is completely fungible. By default, details about senders, recipients and the amount of crypto being transferred are obscured — and Monero advocates says this offers an upper hand over rival privacy coins such as Zcash, which are “selectively transparent.”Obfuscation is achieved through the use of ring signatures. Here, past transaction outputs are picked from the blockchain and act as decoys, meaning that outside observers can’t tell who signed it. If Ian was sending 200 XMR to Susan, this amount could also be split into random chunks to add a further level of difficulty.To ensure that transactions cannot be linked to one another, stealth addresses are created for every single transaction that are only used once.All of these distinctive features have led to XMR being increasingly used for illicit transactions instead of Bitcoin — especially on darknet markets. Governments around the world, especially the U.S., have also offered hundreds of thousands of dollars to anyone who can crack Monero’s code.Related Pages:Find out about Zcash, another privacy coinAll you need to know about the basics of cryptoWhat is a ring signature?CoinMarketCap Blog: Interviews with top crypto influencersMonero is slightly unusual as a token sale wasn’t held for XMR — and no tokens were premined either. At the time of writing, the circulating supply of XMR stands at 17,703,471.This cryptocurrency is designed to be resistant to application-specific integrated circuits, which are commonly used for mining new Bitcoin. In theory, this means that it can be possible to mine XMR using everyday computing equipment.Overall, there will eventually be a total of 18.4 million XMR in circulation — and this cap is expected to be reached on May 31, 2022. After this, miners will be incentivized using “tail emissions,” with a small amount of XMR being fed into the system every 60 seconds as a reward. It is believed this approach is more effective than relying on transaction fees.One of Monero’s main goals has to prevent centralization — and this network uses a consensus mechanism called CryptoNight, which is based on proof-of-work. This prevents large mining farms from becoming a dominant force. Because of its nature as a privacy coin, XMR isn’t listed on some major exchanges. For example, although you can buy XMR on Binance, it isn’t supported by Coinbase. As a result, you may need to convert your fiat into Bitcoin and go through a smaller trading platform. This guide helps explain how you can convert fiat currencies into crypto with ease." ;

:coin_1765_EOS rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual ,
                           :Coin ;
		:about "EOS is a platform that’s designed to allow developers to build decentralized apps (otherwise known as DApps for short.)The project’s goal is relatively simple: to make it as straightforward as possible for programmers to embrace blockchain technology — and ensure that the network is easier to use than rivals. As a result, tools and a range of educational resources are provided to support developers who want to build functional apps quickly.Other priorities include delivering greater levels of scalability than other blockchains, some of which can only handle less than a dozen transactions per second.EOS also aims to improve the experience for users and businesses. While the project tries to deliver greater security and less friction for consumers, it also vies to unlock flexibility and compliance for enterprises.The blockchain launched back in June 2018.The EOS platform was developed by the company Block.one, and its white paper was authored by Daniel Larimer and Brendan Blumer.Both men continue to be members of Block.one’s executive team, with Blumer serving as CEO and Daniel Larimer as CTO.Blumer is a serial entrepreneur, and one of his earliest ventures involved selling virtual assets for video games. He went on to co-found Okay.com, a digitally focused real estate agency in Hong Kong.Larimer is a software programmer who has also started a series of crypto ventures. They include the crypto trading platform BitShares and the Steem blockchain.The pair met in 2016 and formed Block.one the following year.To an extent, you could argue that EOS aims to create familiarity for its users. Whereas EOS.IO is probably best compared to an operating system like Windows or iOS, EOS is the cryptocurrency that drives the network.According to the company, it has the capacity to accommodate the demands of hundreds, if not thousands, of DApps — even if they were being used by substantial numbers of people. Parallel execution, as well as a modular approach, are said to drive this efficiency.In a unique twist, token holders have the ability to vote for block producers — as well as other matters such as protocol upgrades.Unfortunately, some of the most distinguishing features of EOS are those that certain critics dislike the least. There are those that argue that extensive Block.one’s involvement with this project means it’s rather centralized — and some argue this is the opposite of what blockchains and cryptocurrencies were meant to achieve.Basics, how-to guides and deep dives: Learn about crypto with CMC AlexandriaFind out the meaning of crypto and blockchain terms in our glossaryWhat is Steem?CoinMarketCap Blog: In-depth news, features and analysisThere are 936 million EOS coins in circulation at the time of writing, and a total supply of 1.02 billion tokens.Block.one held an initial coin offering for EOS back in June 2017 and it lasted for a year — that’s substantially longer than many of the ICOs seen at the time.A total of $4.02 billion was raised in the process, and investors from the U.S. were unable to take part. Looking at the breakdown of how tokens were distributed, 10% were allocated to the founders, while 90% were distributed among investors. It is worth noting that Block.one won’t receive this allocation straightaway — instead, it’ll happen over a 10-year period.EOS uses a delegated proof-of-stake consensus mechanism. This concept was conceived by Larimer, and aims to solve some of the flaws that are seen in PoW and PoS systems.As we briefly explained earlier, those who own EOS tokens are able to vote for representatives who will be responsible for validating transactions. One of the advantages is that this helps eliminate consolidation, where smaller miners are pushed out by those who have greater levels of computing power and resources.It is possible to buy EOS through Binance, Coinbase, Kraken and countless other exchanges. Given how widely used it is in the crypto industry, you’ll probably be hard pressed to find a trading platform that doesn’t support it. Some services will allow you to use fiat currencies to make a purchase, either through a bank transfer or a credit card. Find out more about fiat on-ramps here." ;

The SHIBA INU WoofPaper has three reasons why their team created SHIB:The SHIBA INU website invites dog-inspired artists from all over the world to foster the “artistic Shiba movement” as they bring their SHIBA INU community into the NFT market.SHIBA INU has also created a campaign using Amazon Smile in order to collect donations for rescue real, live Shiba Inu dogs with the Shiba Inu Rescue Association. Learn more about Dogecoin.Learn more about Dogelon Mars.Learn more about the dog-related meme-coin craze.The SHIBA INU website notes that they locked 50% of the total token supply on Uniswap, and “threw away the keys!” The remaining 50% was “burned to Vitalik Buterin.”There are several other tokens described on the SHIBA INU website — LEASH, which has “been unleashed and will not rebase,” BONE, the “Dogecoin Killer” (which is not yet available as of May 2021).The WoofPaper notes that you will use SHIB to DIG for BONES or ShibaSwap, or even BURY your tokens. “Trainers” can teach their Shibas to SWAP tokens as well — all of these actions create “Returns” that are put into the Puppy Pools, where the #SHIBARMY has the option of BURYING or DIGGING for BONES.In the beginning of May 2021, dog-meme tokens like Shiba Inu saw transaction volumes in the hundreds of millions of dollars.On May 13, Vitalik Buterin (who was given half of the token supply by the developers) announced that he was donating a large amount of these tokens to a fund helping India with COVID relief. The SHIBA developers had not anticipated Buterin selling his tokens, so the relief fund (as of May 18) will have to navigate how to sell the tokens to use the money on aid without preventing market shocks in the SHIB market. At the news of Buterin’s announcement, SHIB dropped 44%.According to 22-page-long SHIB’s WoofPaper, SHIB is based on Ethereum, a proof-of-work blockchain currently transitioning to proof-of-stake.SHIB is listed on Huobi, Binance, Gate.io, Uniswap and OKEx, among other exchanges.For more information about how to buy crypto with fiat, check out CoinMarketCap’s guide here." ;

		:about "FTT is the native cryptocurrency token of the crypto derivatives trading platform FTX that launched on May 8, 2019.The team behind FTX comprises some of the largest crypto traders over the past few years who, having found issues with most mainstream crypto futures exchanges, decided to launch their own platform. FTX claims that it stands out due to such features as clawback prevention, a centralized collateral pool and universal stablecoin settlement.In regards to clawback prevention, a significant amount of customer funds on other derivative exchanges have been claimed by socialized losses. FTX reduces this by using a three-tiered liquidation model.On existing crypto futures exchanges, the collateral is fragmented across separate token wallets this can be difficult for traders as it prevents positions from getting liquidated. On the other hand, FTX derivatives are stablecoin-settled and only require one universal margin wallet.Another feature of the FTT are leveraged tokens, which allow traders to put leveraged positions without the need to trade on margin. If a trader wants to short Bitcoin with 3x leverage, they can simply buy a 3x short Bitcoin leveraged token on FTX. These tokens are ERC20-compatible and can be listed on any spot exchange. FTX currently offers XRP, BNB, TRX, BTC, ETH, EOS, USDT and LEO leveraged tokens.The FTX Token or FTT was founded by Sam Bankman-Fried and Gary Wang.Sam Bankman-Fried is the co-founder and chief executive officer at FTX: Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange. He is also the CEO of Almeda Research and worked as a director of development at the Centre for Effective Altruism. He was also a trader at Jane Street Capital from 2014 to 2017.Bankman-Fried studied physics and has a bachelor’s degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Gary Wang is the co-founder and chief technology officer at FTX: Cryptocurrency Derivatives Exchange. He is also the chief technology officer at Almeda Research. Before this, he worked as a software engineer, after moving up from a software engineering intern at Google. He was also a software engineer intern at Facebook. He has a Bachelors degree in mathematics and computer science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.FTX is backed by Almeda Research, which is known as one of the leading companies in crypto trading and one of the largest liquidity providers.As such, FTX is a product designed by professionals with confirmed expertise in the industry. They cover multiple services: from collateral to maintenance margin to liquidation processes and product listing. FTX also claims to be focused on fast development cycles, allowing them to deploy crypto trading systems at a competitive pace.

The unusual name is based on a Latin citation from one of Aesop’s fables.The cryptocurrency allows Bitfinex users to save money on trading fees. The extent of the discount depends on how much LEO that the customer has in their account — and the savings on offer are spread across three tiers. There are fluctuations depending on whether a trading pair is crypto-to-crypto, or crypto-to stablecoin.UNUS SED LEO launched in May 2019 — and unlike many other cryptocurrencies out there, it is not designed to exist forever.UNUS SED LEO was founded by iFinex after Crypto Capital, the company that processed its payments, saw part of its funds seized by the government. IFinex is the parent company of Bitfinex, which warned that it may not be possible to recover these funds. To cover the financial shortfall, it decided to launch the LEO token.To make good the money lost, iFinex unveiled plans to gradually buy back the token from investors until none are left circulating in the marketplace. A transparency initiative was also launched so the crypto community could monitor the initiative’s progress, and ensure it was meeting stated targets. A token burn mechanism means iFinex is committed to buying back UNUS SED LEO from the market on a monthly basis. The amount that’s purchased and burned is equal to at least 27% of the revenues generated by iFinex — and tokens are also purchased at the market rate. In a news release at the time, the company said: “The burn mechanism will continue until 100% of tokens have been redeemed.”Whereas some cryptocurrencies just launch on a single blockchain, LEO tokens were issued on two blockchains. While 64% of the original supply was on Ethereum, the remaining 36% could be found on EOS.Related Pages:Discover the newest cryptocurrencies added to CoinMarketCapRead our straightforward crypto how-to guidesCoinMarketCap: Interviews, on-chain analysis and more As we mentioned, the circulating supply of LEO tokens is designed to diminish over time. Originally, the total supply was set at 1 billion.LEO was sold for $1 apiece on a 1:1 basis with the Tether stablecoin, meaning that a total of $1 billion was raised over a 10-day period.There were 660 million ERC-20 tokens at launch, as well as 340 million EOS-based tokens — and Bitfinex allows conversions between the two chains to be made with ease.At the time, the company described the dual protocol launch as “unique” — and vowed that it would empower the Bitfinex community.These tokens are based on Ethereum and EOS respectively. A dashboard has been released by Bitfinex that offers up-to-minute information on the current supply, and how many LEO tokens have been burned. Bar charts compare LEO burns on a daily basis.UNUS SED LEO is available on Bitfinex, Gate.io, OKEx and others. Common trading pairs connect LEO with the U.S. dollar, the USDT stablecoin, Bitcoin and Ethereum. You can find out more about how to convert fiat currencies into Bitcoin here." ;

		:about "PancakeSwap is an automated market maker (AMM) — a decentralized finance (DeFi) application that allows users to exchange tokens, providing liquidity via farming and earning fees in return.It launched in September 2020 and is a decentralized exchange for swapping BEP20 tokens on Binance Smart Chain. PancakeSwap uses an automated market maker model where users trade against a liquidity pool. These pools are filled by users who deposit their funds into the pool and receive liquidity provider (LP) tokens in return.These tokens can later be used to reclaim their share of the pool, as well as a portion of the trading fees. These LP tokens are known as FLIP. PancakeSwap also allows users to farm additional tokens such as CAKE and SYRUP. On the farm, users can deposit LP tokens and get rewarded with CAKE. PancakeSwap allows users to trade BEP20 tokens, provide liquidity to the exchange and earn fees, stake LP tokens to earn CAKE, stake CAKE to earn more CAKE and stake CAKE to earn tokens of other projects. PancakeSwap is a Binance Smart Chain-based decentralized exchange (DEX) that was launched by anonymous developers with an apparent passion for pancakes.PancakeSwap uses an automated market maker model, meaning that there are no order books and liquidity pools are used instead. A user can earn income by becoming a liquidity provide by adding their tokens to the liquidity pool they can farm LP tokens and stake their CAKE to earn rewards. They can also try their luck with the lotteries and non-fungible tokens. The PancakeSwap token CAKE is a BEP20 token that originally launched on Binance Smart Chain. The main function of CAKE is to incentivize the liquidity provision to the PancakeSwap platform.Users can stake their tokens to earn rewards, which is done by depositing Liquidity Provider tokens and locking them up. This is known as farming and is rewarded by the system with CAKE tokens. The tokens can be un-staked with zero holding time. CAKE gives users the opportunity to invest and increase returns in the future but comes with risks.CAKE can be used to enter a lottery on PancakeSwap. Each lottery session takes 6 hours. A single ticket costs 10 CAKE and comes with a random combination of four numbers between 1 and 14, for example, 8-6-4-13. To win the jackpot, which equals 50% of the entire lottery pool, the numbers in your ticket need to match all four of the numbers in the winning ticket.Users can also win non-fungible tokens that can be traded for CAKE or kept in a wallet.Learn about Waves.Learn about Vertcoin.Learn about Dego Finance on CMC Alexandria.Increase your knowledge of crypto with the CoinMarketCap blog.As of March 2021, PancakeSwap (CAKE) has a circulating supply of 125,984,870 CAKE coins and no maximum supply data is available.PancakeSwap can be securely stored on supported wallets that are connected to the Binance Smart Chain. These include MetaMask, TrustWallet, TokenPocket and WalletConnect.PancakeSwap (CAKE) can be bought and sold on the following exchanges:If you are interested in learning more about how to purchase Bitcoin (BTC), you can read CoinMarketCap’s comprehensive guide." ;

		:about "Theta Fuel (TFUEL) is one of the two native tokens on the Theta blockchain. TFUEL should not be mistaken for Theta Token (THETA), which is the governance token of the Theta blockchain supported by thousands of community-run Guardian nodes and its Enterprise validators including Google, Binance, Blockchain ventures, Gumi and Samsung.TFUEL is the second token on the Theta blockchain that serves as the utility token in decentralized video and data delivery, it also acts as a gas token. This means that it is used to power all operations on the Theta blockchain, like payments to relayers for sharing a video stream, for deploying and interacting with smart contracts, and as fees associated with transacting NTFs and DeFi applications.In addition, it is also used to incentivize users in the ecosystem who share their redundant computing power as Edge Compute nodes as well as bandwidth resources as Edge Caching nodes for video streams and other data.Theta Fuel, and in extension, the entire Theta Ecosystem, was co-founded by Mitch Liu and Jieyi Long in 2017. Liu has a long history in the gaming, video and virtual reality industries, co-founding video advertising firm Tapjoy, mobile social gaming startup Gameview Studios, and THETA.tv, the live streaming platform whose DApp was the first to be built on the Theta protocol.Jieyi Long is Theta’s second co-founder and CTO, following similar multi-year experience in design automation, gaming, VR, and large scale distributed systems. He authored multiple peer-reviewed academic papers and holds various patents in video streaming, blockchain and virtual reality. Theta now has a modest team, and its official website lists strategic corporate investors as Samsung NEXT, Sony Innovation Fund, media investors BDMI Bertelsmann Digital Media Investments, CAA Creative Artists Agency, and traditional Silicon Valley VCs including DCM, Sierra Ventures and the VR Fund.Theta’s main use case is decentralizing video streaming, data delivery and edge computing, making it more efficient, cost-effective and fair for industry participants. The network runs on a native blockchain, with two native tokens, known as Theta (THETA) and Theta Fuel (TFUEL), powering the internal economy.Theta’s appeal is threefold: viewers get rewarded with better quality streaming service, content creators improve their earnings and middlemen — video platforms — save money on building infrastructure and increase advertising, subscription revenues. Users have an incentive to both watch network content and share network resources, as rewards come in the form of TFUEL tokens.The platform is open source, and token holders receive governance powers as with many proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain ecosystems. In addition to video, data and computing, Theta caters to developers looking to launch decentralized applications (DApps) such as DeFi and NFTs on its fully featured EVM-compatible smart contract platform.As earlier mentioned, there are two coins in the Theta ecosystem THETA and TFUEL. Both coins are used as the main tools for interaction on the Theta blockchain, yet serve different functions.There are currently 5,232,675,200 TFUEL coins in circulation, which grows each year as new TFUEL is generated for staking rewards. Theta Tokens are fixed and at their max supply, which means there are 1,000,000,000 coins in circulation which will never increase.Theta runs on the proof-of-stake algorithm, which means staking is possible. Since the amount of THETA in circulation is the max supply there will ever be, TFUEL is the reward for staking on the network. To qualify for staking, you have to stake at least 1,000 THETA to a Guardian Node or run your own Guardian Node.The Theta Blockchain relies on a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. It, however, adds a multi-level Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus mechanism on its blockchain to achieve better security along with higher transaction throughput.At the time of Theta Mainnet launch in March 2019, Theta introduced Guardian Nodes. With the Guardian Node, no single entity controls the majority of THETA tokens being staked at any one time. This further helps the network achieve a high transaction throughput of 1000+ TPS.Theta uses a financial incentive scheme to ensure user participation in governance activities, and hence its network is secured by its own users.Trying to find your way as a crypto newbie?

		:about "Maker (MKR) is the governance token of the MakerDAO and Maker Protocol — respectively a decentralized organization and a software platform, both based on the Ethereum blockchain — that allows users to issue and manage the DAI stablecoin.Initially conceived in 2015 and fully launched in December 2017, Maker is a project whose task is to operate DAI, a community-managed decentralized cryptocurrency with a stable value soft-pegged to the US dollar.MKR tokens act as a kind of voting share for the organization that manages DAI while they do not pay dividends to their holders, they do give the holders voting rights over the development of Maker Protocol and are expected to appreciate in value in accordance with the success of DAI itself.The Maker ecosystem is one of the earliest projects on the decentralized finance (DeFi) scene: the industry that seeks to build decentralized financial products on top of smart-contract-enabled blockchains, such as Ethereum.MakerDAO, the first entity inside the larger Maker ecosystem, was created in 2015 by Rune Christensen, an entrepreneur from Sealand, Denmark.Christensen graduated from Copenhagen University with a degree in biochemistry and studied international business at the Copenhagen Business School. Prior to MakerDAO, he co-founded and managed the Try China international recruiting company.As of October 2020, DAI is one of the most popular stablecoins (cryptocurrencies whose prices are pegged to the USD or another traditional currency). It is the 25th largest cryptocurrency at over $800 million in market capitalization and it has more active addresses than USDT — the largest stablecoin on the market.MKR’s unique proposition lies in the fact that it allows its holders to directly participate in the process of governing DAI. Every holder of Maker tokens has the right to vote on a number of changes to the Maker Protocol, with their voting power depending on the size of their MKR stake. Some of the aspects of the protocol the holders can vote on are:This ability to participate in the management of one of the largest stablecoins on the market is what drives the demand for MKR tokens and correspondingly affects their value.Find out more about USDT, another USD-pegged stable cryptocurrencyLearn more about stablecoins on CMC Alexandria, our educational portal.The issuance and removal of MKR from the system is governed by a complex system of interdependent mechanisms designed to ensure that DAI is always fully collateralized by other cryptocurrency assets and its soft peg to the USD is maintained. There is no hard-coded limit on the total supply of MKR.DAI’s value is secured by collateral — other cryptocurrencies that are deposited by users when minting new DAI tokens and stored in so-called vaults — smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.During price downswings, the value of crypto stored in the vault might become insufficient to fully collateralize the corresponding amount of DAI. In that case, the Maker Protocol automatically initiates the liquidation of the vault’s contents, the proceeds of which it uses to cover that vault’s obligations. If the amount of DAI generated during the liquidation is not enough, the Maker Protocol mints new MKR tokens to sell and cover the remaining sum, thereby increasing the total supply.However, in some cases, the amount of DAI made from the auctions exceeds the necessary limit to ensure full collateralizations — then, it is used by the Maker Protocol to buy back and burn MKR tokens, decreasing their total supply.Thus, the supply of MKR is a dynamic value that changes depending on market conditions and the overall health of the DAI ecosystem. As of October 2020, the circulating supply of Maker tokens is about 1 million, worth more than $500 million.MKR is an ERC-20 token, meaning that it runs on and is secured by the Ethereum blockchain. Ethereum, in turn, is secured by its Ethash proof-of-work function.Maker token trading is available on such exchanges as:" ;

		:about "Neo bills itself as a “rapidly growing and developing” ecosystem that has the goal of becoming the foundation for the next generation of the internet — a new economy where digitized payments, identities and assets come together.Initially known as Antshares, this project was believed to be China’s first-ever public blockchain when it was launched in February 2014. The open-source platform subsequently rebranded to Neo three years later.As well as creating a worldwide community of developers who create new infrastructure for the network and lower barriers to entry, the team behind this project operate an EcoBoost initiative that’s designed to encourage people to build decentralized apps and smart contracts on its blockchain.It’s often been likened to the Chinese version of the Ethereum network.The co-founders of Neo, and its predecessor Antshares, are Da Hongfei and Erik Zhang. Both serve as chairmen of the Neo Foundation, which aims to promote the blockchain’s adoption.Da Hongfei has said that, although the internet is a great invention, it has many flaws — and this means that everyday consumers don’t always have control over their own data. The entrepreneur believes blockchain applications will eventually go mainstream.Erik Zhang was the author of the Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm, which aims to deter untrustworthy participants from taking part in the blockchain’s operation. This technology went on to be used in the Neo blockchain. He also served as the core developer for this network, and is playing an instrumental role in the development of Neo 3.0, the next iteration of the project’s infrastructure.One of the unique selling points of the Neo blockchain concerns its continuous development, which helps ensure that it is futureproof and able to cope with sudden increases in demand. As mentioned earlier, the project has developed Neo 3.0 — enhancing network security and allowing a greater number of transactions per second to be processed.Unlike many other blockchains, this network also has two native tokens: NEO and GAS. While NEO serves as an investment token and allows people to participate in votes concerning improvements to the blockchain, GAS is used to pay fees for the transactions that are being completed on the network.Few other blockchain projects also run a development fund to the extent that Neo does. EcoBoost launched back in 2019, and it was billed as an initiative that provides “full life-cycle support for high-potential projects” — including grants, technical support and promotion on social media.Related Pages: Find out more about GAS, the second native token to NeoHow does Neo compare with Ethereum?Explore our comprehensive crypto how-to guidesWhat’s going on in the crypto industry? Find out in our blogAt the time of writing, there are 70.5 million NEO in circulation — and a total supply of 100 million. NEO tokens aren’t mined, and indeed, all 100 million of them were generated when the blockchain launched.These tokens were distributed on a 50/50 basis — with half going to participants in a token sale, and the other half being split among developers and the NEO Council. At the time, it was confirmed that these funds would be used to invest in other blockchain protocol that the organization supports.Meanwhile, GAS is generated every 20 seconds or so, whenever a new block is created. The number of tokens created gradually reduces every year, and it’s estimated that it’ll take 22 years for the total supply of 100 million to enter circulation.As we mentioned earlier, Neo uses Delegated Byzantine Fault Tolerance, and it’s estimated that the blockchain is capable of processing thousands of transactions per second.According to Neo, the dBFT mechanism has been inspired by the Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance algorithm.There are a couple of similarities with delegated proof-of-stake, given how both consensus mechanisms allow token holders to vote for the delegates who will process transactions.Through dBFT, blocks are added to a blockchain as long as at least two-thirds of delegates reach consensus — and it’s hoped that this helps prevent bad actors from undermining the smooth running of the network.NEO can be purchased on a number of exchanges — most people buy NEO on Binance, Poloniex and HitBTC. But it isn’t available universally and isn’t supported by some platforms, such as Coinbase.Many exchanges offer trading pairs that link NEO with Bitcoin.

		:about "Terra is a blockchain protocol that uses fiat-pegged stablecoins to power price-stable global payments systems. According to its white paper, Terra combines the price stability and wide adoption of fiat currencies with the censorship-resistance of Bitcoin (BTC) and offers fast and affordable settlements.Development on Terra began in January 2018, and its mainnet officially launched in April 2019. As of September 2020, it offers stablecoins pegged to the U.S. dollar, South Korean won, Mongolian tugrik and the International Monetary Funds Special Drawing Rights basket of currencies — and it intends to roll out additional options.Terras native token, LUNA, is used to stabilize the price of the protocols stablecoins. LUNA holders are also able to submit and vote on governance proposals.Terra was founded in January 2018 by Daniel Shin and Do Kwon. The two conceived of the project as a way to drive the rapid adoption of blockchain technology and cryptocurrency through a focus on price stability and usability. Kwon took on the position of CEO of Terraform Labs, the company behind Terra.Prior to developing Terra, Shin co-founded and headed Ticket Monster, otherwise known as TMON — a major South Korean e-commerce platform. He later co-founded Fast Track Asia, a startup incubator working with entrepreneurs to build fully functional companies. Kwon previously founded and served as CEO of Anyfi, a startup providing decentralized wireless mesh networking solutions. He has also worked as a software engineer for Microsoft and Apple.Terra seeks to set itself apart through its use of fiat-pegged stablecoins, stating that it combines the borderless benefits of cryptocurrencies with the day-to-day price stability of fiat currencies. It keeps its one-to-one peg through an algorithm that automatically adjusts stablecoin supply based on its demand. It does so by incentivizing LUNA holders to swap LUNA and stablecoins at profitable exchange rates, as needed, to either expand or contract the stablecoin supply to match demand.Terra has established a number of partnerships with payments platforms, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. In July 2019, Terra announced a partnership with Chai, a South Korea-based mobile payments application, in which purchases made using the application on e-commerce platforms are processed via the Terra blockchain network. Each transaction is subject to (on average) a 2%–3% fee charged to the merchant.In addition, Terra is supported by the Terra Alliance, a group of businesses and platforms advocating for the adoption of Terra. In February 2019, the company announced that e-commerce platforms from 10 different countries, representing a user base of 45 million and a gross merchandise value of $25 billion, were members of the alliance.Learn about Tether, the most popular stablecoin by market capitalization.Learn about Zilliqa, another cryptocurrency project seeking to revolutionize the payments sector.Want to better understand stablecoins? Read an in-depth guide on Alexandria, CoinMarketCaps online educational resource.Stay up to date on the ways stablecoins are changing the payments industry with the CoinMarketCap Blog.Terra has a supply of 1 billion tokens. If this number is exceeded, LUNA is burned until it returns to the equilibrium supply level. New LUNA tokens are minted through the protocols algorithm, as needed, in order to maintain the price of Terra stablecoins.LUNA was first made available for purchase in a private token sale for initial investors, which included the investment arms of major exchanges such as Binance, OKEx and Huobi. The sale concluded in August 2018, and as a result, Terra raised $32 million. Of the 385,245,974 LUNA minted for the sale, 10% was reserved for Terraform Labs, 20% for employees and project contributors, 20% for the Terra Alliance, 20% for price stability reserves, 26% for project backers and 4% for genesis liquidity.The Terra blockchain is secured using a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm based on Tendermint, in which LUNA token holders stake their tokens as collateral to validate transactions, receiving rewards in proportion to the amount of LUNA staked. Tokenholders may also delegate others to validate transactions on their behalf, sharing in any revenue generated. Terra also offers additional guidance to validator nodes on the best practices for helping to keep the network secure.In May 2019, shortly after Terras mainnet went live, blockchain verification and penetration testing firm CertiK completed a security audit of the network. It examined its economic model to test against market manipulation, its architecture and its coding language. CertiK found that the modeling and mathematical reasoning of the Terra network were considered sound, although it would not comment on the blockchains performance.Terras native token, LUNA, is listed on several cryptocurrency exchanges — including Huobi, Bitfinex and Upbit — where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies, stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies.Are you interested in buying LUNA or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

		:about "Crypto.com Coin (CRO) is the native cryptocurrency token of Crypto.com Chain — a decentralized, open-source blockchain developed by the Crypto.com payment, trading and financial services company.Crypto.com Chain is one of the products in Crypto.com’s lineup of solutions designed to accelerate the global adoption of cryptocurrencies as a means of increasing personal control over money, safeguarding user data and protecting users’ identities. The CRO blockchain serves primarily as a vehicle that powers the Crypto.com Pay mobile payments app.In the future, Crypto.com plans to expand the reach of the CRO platform to power its other products as well.CRO went live in November-December 2018.Crypto.com Coin was launched by the Crypto.com company as part of its vision of “putting cryptocurrency in every wallet.” Crypto.com itself was founded in June 2016 as “Monaco Technologies GmbH” by Kris Marszalek, Rafael Melo, Gary Or and Bobby Bao.Kris Marszalek, an alum of the Polish Adam Mickiewicz University, has founded and headed three companies prior to starting Crypto.com: consumer electronics design and manufacturing business Starline Polska, location-based service mobile app and platform YIYI and the e-commerce firm BEECRAZY.Rafael Melo earned his bachelor’s degree in engineering from the PUC-Rio. Over his more than 15-year-long career in finance, Melo has worked with major companies in Asia and helped secure over 50 million AUD in funding for the Ensogo social commerce website.Gary Or is a software engineer with over nine years of fullstack engineering experience. Prior to co-founding Crypto.com, Or worked as platform architect at Ensogo and co-founded the mobile app development firm Foris. He received his bachelor’s degree in engineering, computer science from the University of Hong Kong.Before helping launch Crypto.com, Bobby Bao worked in the M&A department of the China Renaissance investment bank. Bao has studied at the University of Melbourne, NYU Stern School of Business and the College of William & Mary.CRO blockchain is mainly focused on providing utility to the users of Crypto.com’s payment, trading and financial services solutions.CRO owners can stake their coins on the Crypto.com Chain to act as a validator and earn fees for processing transactions on the network. Additionally, CRO coins can be used to settle transaction fees on the Crypto.com Chain.Within the framework of the Crypto.com Pay payments app, users can get cashback of up to 20% by paying merchants in CRO and up to 10% by purchasing gift cards and making peer-to-peer transfers to other users.When it comes to trading use cases, the Crypto.com App allows users to earn token rewards for select listings by staking CRO.Additionally, users can earn annual interest of up to 10-12% on their Crypto.com Coins by staking them on either the Crypto.com Exchange app or Crypto.com’s metal Visa Card.Overall, CRO acts as an instrument that powers Crypto.com’s drive to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies on a global scale. As such, the company is continuously working on finding and developing new use cases that will allow users to leverage the cryptocurrency to enhance the control they have over their money, data and identities.Learn about BNB and HT, two other popular tokens designed to power and incentivize the use of their parent platforms.Check out CMC Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s educational portal.The total supply of CRO is limited to 100 billion coins, all of which were created when the blockchain went live — making it a non-mineable cryptocurrency. Crypto.com did not rely on pre-sales, public-sales or an initial coin offering (ICO) — instead, the coins will only be distributed via secondary distribution.The total supply of CRO will be allocated for five different purposes:CRO is built on top of Ethereum’s (ETH) blockchain according to the ERC-20 compatibility standard, which means that its network is secured by the Ethash function.CRO coins are available at multiple cryptocurrency exchanges, some of which are:" ;

		:about "Bitcoin SV is the result of a lot of drama on the BTC blockchain.It all began when Bitcoin suffered a hard fork in 2017 — splitting the network and resulting in the creation of a new altcoin called Bitcoin Cash.A year later, in 2018, Bitcoin Cash suffered a hard fork of its own, and Bitcoin SV was born.Bitcoin SV (SV stands for Satoshi Vision) bills itself as the original Bitcoin — a cryptocurrency that stays true to the goals of pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto. BSV’s main aims include delivering stability and achieving scalability, something that the original BTC blockchain has struggled to achieve.The project’s website says: “Bitcoin SV is intended to provide a clear choice for miners and allow businesses to build applications and websites on it reliably.”One person who has been closely associated with the creation of Bitcoin SV is the Australian entrepreneur Craig Wright, who himself has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto. He’s the founder of the fintech company nChain, and he lobbied in favour of the hard fork because he disagreed with upgrade proposals that had been put forward for BSV.The entrepreneur Calvin Ayre has also been a vocal supporter of Bitcoin SV, and has regularly sought investment opportunities in projects that have been built on top of the blockchain.There are several markets that BSV is hoping to target — and use cases it wants to achieve that advocates say the likes of Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash can’t provide.BTC is regarded by some as a speculative asset, rather than one that is well-suited to everyday payments. By contrast, BSV claims that it can “replace every payment system in the world with a better user experience, a cheaper merchant cost, and a safer level of security.”Bitcoin SV also wants to serve as an enterprise blockchain solution for companies who are interested in learning more about what this technology has to offer.When compared with its older siblings, BSV aims to stand out from a scalability perspective, too. Bitcoin SV claims it has a much bigger block size than its predecessors, and as a result, it can handle more transactions on a daily basis.Find out about BCH, the altcoin BSV forked fromHow does BSV compare with BTC and BSV in the rankings?Learn more about Bitcoin with CMC Alexandria’s crypto basicsBitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash vs Bitcoin SVAlthough BSV aims to offer some tangible improvements over BTC, there are some things that these two cryptocurrencies continue to have in common: their maximum supply of 21 million.Just like Bitcoin, Bitcoin SV also undergoes halvings, where block rewards for miners are cut by 50%. The only difference is that, whereas Bitcoin has now had three of these events – in 2012, 2016 and 2020 – Bitcoin SV has only had one.The similarities don’t end here. Bitcoin SV also uses the proof-of-work consensus mechanism. In case you’re unfamiliar with this concept, here’s a reminder: before a block can be added to a chain, miners must find the answer to a complex mathematical puzzle using their computing power. The miner who does this first gets a block reward, and this infrastructure helps to prevent malicious attacks. Bitcoin SV is listed on major exchanges including OKEx and Bitfinex — as well as dozens of smaller platforms. However, it is not listed on Binance. This company decided to delist BSV in 2019 because BSV didn’t meet its standards. To learn more about how you can convert fiat currencies into crypto, click here." ;

                           :Coin ;
		:about "Tezos is a blockchain network that’s based on smart contracts, in a way that’s not too dissimilar to Ethereum. However, there’s a big difference: Tezos aims to offer infrastructure that is more advanced — meaning it can evolve and improve over time without there ever being a danger of a hard fork. This is something that both Bitcoin and Ethereum have suffered since they were created. People who hold XTZ can vote on proposals for protocol upgrades that have been put forward by Tezos developers.This open-source platform bills itself as “secure, upgradable and built to last” — and says its smart contract language provides the accuracy that is required for high-value use cases. According to Tezos, its approach means that it is futureproof and will “remain state-of-the-art long into the future,” meaning it can embrace developments in blockchain technology.The technology underpinning Tezos was first proposed in a white paper that was released in September 2014. After a series of delays, the Tezos mainnet launched four years later.Arthur Breitman was the man who wrote the Tezos white paper — and in a nod to Satoshi Nakamoto, he wrote his works under the pen name L. M. Goodman. He argued that one of Bitcoin’s biggest failings was the lack of a governance process that invited contributions from the community who use the network — as well as the fact that new tokens couldn’t be issued through this blockchain.He and his wife Kathleen founded a startup called Dynamic Ledger Solutions which was tasked with writing the code that would underpin the Tezos protocol. This company was subsequently purchased by the Tezos Foundation to ensure that it owned all of the intellectual property rights relating to the network.Although staking is common across blockchains, Tezos has a unique twist on this process. Participants can get involved with the network’s governance through “baking,” where they effectively stake 8,000 XTZ. This creates a financial incentive to act honestly.Bakers are then tasked with voting on proposed changes to the blockchain’s code in a four-step procedure that takes approximately 23 days. Proposals that receive support from the vast majority of participants are put through their paces on a testnet for 48 hours and are fully implemented if they are backed by a super-majority.Tezos is also unique because of how it has started to be used by high-profile businesses. In September 2020, it was announced that the French banking giant Societe Generale planned to use this blockchain for experimenting with a central bank digital currency.Big cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance and Coinbase have also unveiled support for Tezos staking, meaning users can receive rewards based on the XTZ that they hold. This is not a feature that’s seen too widely across digital assets.Related Pages:Read in-depth tech deep dives on CMC AlexandriaGlossary: What is staking?Discover which cryptos have recently been added to CMCCoinMarketCap Blog: The latest features and analysisA Deep Dive Into TezosOur data shows that 743,862,304 XTZ are in circulation at the time of writing.A token sale for Tezos was held back in July 2017 — and during this ICO, a total of 65,681 BTC and 361,122 ETH was raised. At the time, this was worth $232 million, securing its place as one of the largest initial coin offerings ever held.While 80% of this initial supply went to investors, 20% was split equally between the Tezos Foundation and Dynamic Ledger Solutions.The mainnet’s launch was delayed by a series of lawsuits from some disgruntled investors, who argued that XTZ amounted to unregistered securities.Like other blockchains, Tezos uses a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism.Anyone can become a validator and contribute to the smooth running of the network by making a security deposit. To incentivize honest behavior, rewards are given to those who work in the best interests of the blockchain — and those who act dishonestly risk losing their stake altogether.XTZ, otherwise known as “tez” for short, can be purchased from most major exchanges — including Binance, Coinbase and others. Trading pairs unite XTZ with fiat currencies, as well as other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. If you’re looking to convert fiat into Bitcoin, you can read a comprehensive guide here.Tezos Nodes is a reliability rating public Tezos Bakers and a service for monitoring the state of node performance for non-public Tezos Bakers.Working with the baking community, the team developed a baker reliability index that features 10 key indicators.

:coin_1720_MIOTA rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual ,
                           :Coin ;
		:about "IOTA is a distributed ledger with one big difference: it isn’t actually a blockchain. Instead, its proprietary technology is known as Tangle, a system of nodes that confirm transactions. The foundation behind this platform says this offers far greater speeds than conventional blockchains — and an ideal footprint for the ever-expanding Internet of Things ecosystem.Because there’s no blockchain, there are no miners, and because there are no miners, there are no fees. Many established networks see costs balloon when congestion intensifies, but IOTA aims to provide limitless throughput at minimal expense.In time, IOTA’s goal is to become the de facto platform for executing transactions between IoT devices. Given how estimates suggest there could be 20.4 billion such devices out there by 2024, this could end up being big business.The team behind IOTA believe that the potential use cases don’t end here. They believe their distributed ledger could deliver digital identities to all, result in car insurance policies that are based on actual usage, pave the way for cutting-edge smart cities, deliver seamless global trade and prove the authenticity of products.Originally known as Jinn, a crowdsale for the project was held in September 2014, and the network officially launched in 2016.IOTA has four co-founders, and their names are Sergey Ivancheglo, Serguei Popov, David Sønstebø and Dominik Schiener.According to the IOTA Foundation, the initiative has rapidly grown since then — and team members are now based across more than 25 countries.Sonstebo and Schiener are collectively co-chairmen of the board of directors, while Popov is a board member and the foundation’s director of research.Ivancheglo resigned from the Berlin-based project back in June 2019 but continues as an unofficial advisor. At the time, he said in a statement: “I no longer believe that the IOTA Foundation is the best setting for me to realize what we set out to create back in 2014 and 2015. I have always done my best work in a less rigid environment. I am looking forward to continuing the work on both hardware and software development of IOTA independently.”Well, as we alluded to a little earlier, the fact that it’s effectively a blockchainless blockchain is rather unusual to say the least.Tangle’s more technical name is the Directed Acyclic Graph — and as Sønstebø explained in a blog post back in 2015, this technology aims to retain blockchain’s ability to execute secure transactions. The only difference is that it does away with the notion of blocks.He also wrote: “IOTA should not be considered an alternative coin (altcoin) to existing cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, rather it is an extension of the growing blockchain ecosystem. It’s meant to work in synergy with these other platforms to form cohesion and symbiotic relationships. IOTA is designed to provide one solution that no other crypto does: efficient, secure, lightweight, real-time micro-transactions without fees.”New transactions are validated by approving two previous transactions from another node — and this is a novel approach because it means that the network’s size and speed will be directly related to how many people are using the platform.And whereas some cryptocurrencies are run as a business, the IOTA Foundation says it is firmly not for profit — adding that it has the sole goal of making the network as prosperous as possible.Finally, IOTA has distinguished itself from many other crypto rivals by establishing high-profile partnerships with the carmaker Volkswagen, and helping the city of Taipei to pursue smart projects.Read our deep dives into the latest crypto technologyThe latest data on crypto’s market cap and trading volumesToday’s top stories in the crypto and blockchain industryCoinMarketCap Blog: Analysis, opinion, news and updatesMIOTA has a maximum supply of 2,779,530,283 tokens — and all of them are in circulation.When the crowdsale was held, this digital asset was billed as a utility token that could be used for payment across its network, rather than a profit-sharing coin.An incredibly precise 999,999,999 were sold during the 2015 crowdsale, and this generated revenue of 1,337 BTC for the foundation. Given that Bitcoin was only worth about $325 at the time, this could have resulted in a substantial windfall for the team in later years.It is worth noting that the supply of MIOTA did increase in later years, with the team arguing that a greater level of supply would make the token suitable for the “tiny nano transactions” that we’ll likely see through IoT devices.The IOTA Foundation launched in October 2017, and at the time, it owned approximately 5% of the tokens that are in circulation, and these were donated by the community. It said “the majority of these funds will go towards building an army of developers and researchers.”Given how the IOTA network isn’t a blockchain, you may not think that it would have much need for a consensus mechanism. However, to help keep the network secure, a relatively straightforward Proof-of-Work puzzle is included in the process of validating a transaction.There have been security concerns surrounding IOTA. In the past, researchers have claimed they have found vulnerabilities in the project’s code.MIOTA is available on multiple exchanges — many people choose to buy MIOTA on Binance, Bitfinex, and OKEx. According to the project, a range of trading pairs are available, linking the token with Bitcoin, Ethereum, stablecoins, and fiat currencies including the Japanese yen, euro, pound, and dollar.

		:about "Launched in June 2019, Klaytn is a public blockchain platform providing an accessible user experience and development environment in order to convey the value of blockchain technology. The platform combines the best features of both public blockchains (decentralized data and control, distributed governance) and private blockchains (low latency, high scalability) via an efficient hybrid design.Klaytn aims to bring blockchain technology to all types of users, from micro startups to enterprise divisions. The company’s mission is to make decentralization via blockchain available on a global scale. In addition, the project has already secured interest from numerous highly reputable brands around the world.Jaesun Han is the founder and CEO of GroundX, the company behind the Klaytn blockchain. Han has a Ph.D. in electrical engineering and computer science from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology. His professional career started as a postdoctoral researcher for KAIST, where he conducted extensive research into distributed computing.His first jump towards entrepreneurship was in 2007, when Jaesun Han founded NexR, the first big data and cloud computing tech startup in Korea. In 2008, Han took up a position as a chairman of the board of the Consortium of Cloud Computing Research. In November 2011, Jaesun Han became the CTO of KT Cloudware, a company dedicated to technically support KT Ucloud services.Aside from his business and entrepreneurial ventures, Jaesun Han is also a credited adjunct professor at KAIST. You can easily deploy your own chain or join other chains on Klaytn without any technical knowledge required you dont need to be an expert in cryptography or have a deep understanding of blockchain technology. Without the need to consult a highly specialized technical advisor, anyone can launch their own token economy ecosystem on Klaytn, according to their literature.As an ecosystem of a wide array of decentralized applications (DApps), Klaytn presents users with the opportunity to find or develop the right type of application for their needs. Because of the decentralized nature of the platform, users have virtually unlimited use cases before them, as app publication is not restricted. Klaytn supports DApps in a multitude of spheres, including digital asset management, art collecting and trade, game development, and decentralized exchanges. Because of this versatility, Klaytn has attracted the attention of institutional investors like Humanspace, Wemade Tree and Piction Network. Read more about Definex.Find out more about Phala Network.Learn more about Byzantine fault tolerances.Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.With an undefined maximum supply, and a current total supply of 10,527,368,819 KLAY tokens, the Klaytn blockchain is gaining popularity among crypto enthusiasts. The current circulating supply is 2,448,059,130 KLAY tokens. With every new block, newly issued KLAY and the sum of transaction fees used in the block (collectively called a “block reward”) are aggregated and distributed to the following three destination accounts following the predetermined ratio: the Klaytn Governance Council receives 34% of the supply, the blockchain consensus gets another 54% of the supply and the remaining 12% are dedicated to the Klaytn Improvement reserve (KIR).Klaytn recognizes that proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms have drawbacks, which is why the network relies on an optimized version of an Istanbul BFT, which implements Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT) with modifications to achieve the necessary blockchain network characteristics. Klaytn also introduces a proof-of-contribution (PoC), which is designed to compensate all participants in the Klaytn token economy that make meaningful contributions. By combining these consensus mechanisms, Klaytn achieves a versatile, decentralized environment, ensuring that block validators are incentivized for performing their duties. Not only that, the blockchain successfully accomplishes the mission to be an enterprise-ready and service-centric environment for its users through this hybrid consensus approach. The Klaytn platform is attracting enterprise investors’ attention, which is why it has been climbing up among the most popular altcoins. If you want to purchase KLAY tokens, your best option is Coinone, which has the largest trading volume at $110,659,556 as of Apr. 5, 2021.Other good options if you are looking to purchase KLAY include:Find more information here about buying cryptos." ;

		:about " In a nutshell, Cosmos bills itself as a project that solves some of the “hardest problems” facing the blockchain industry. It aims to offer an antidote to “slow, expensive, unscalable and environmentally harmful” proof-of-work protocols, like those used by Bitcoin, by offering an ecosystem of connected blockchains.The project’s other goals include making blockchain technology less complex and difficult for developers thanks to a modular framework that demystifies decentralized apps. Last but not least, an Interblockchain Communication protocol makes it easier for blockchain networks to communicate with each other — preventing fragmentation in the industry.Cosmos’ origins can be dated back to 2014, when Tendermint, a core contributor to the network, was founded. In 2016, a white paper for Cosmos was published — and a token sale was held the following year. ATOM tokens are earned through a hybrid proof-of-stake algorithm, and they help to keep the Cosmos Hub, the project’s flagship blockchain, secure. This cryptocurrency also has a role in the network’s governance.The co-founders of Tendermint — the gateway to the Cosmos ecosystem — were Jae Kwon, Zarko Milosevic and Ethan Buchman. Although Kwon is still listed as principal architect, he stepped down as CEO in 2020. He maintains he is still a part of the project but is mainly focusing on other initiatives. He has now been replaced as Tendermint’s CEO by Peng Zhong, and the whole board of directors was given quite a substantial refresh. Their goals include enhancing the experience for developers, creating an enthusiastic community for Cosmos and building educational resources so greater numbers of people are aware of what this network is capable of.A major concern for some in the crypto industry centers on the levels of fragmentation seen in blockchain networks. There are hundreds in existence, but very few of them can communicate with each other. Cosmos aims to turn this on its head by making this possible.Cosmos is described as “Blockchain 3.0” — and as we mentioned earlier, a big goal is ensuring that its infrastructure is straightforward to use. To this end, the Cosmos software development kit focuses on modularity. This allows a network to be easily built using chunks of code that already exist. Long-term, it’s hoped that complex applications will be straightforward to construct as a result. Scalability is another priority, meaning substantially more transactions can be processed a second than more old-fashioned blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. If blockchains are to ever achieve mainstream adoption, they’ll need to be able to cope with demand as well as existing payment processing companies or websites — or be even better.Check out simple definitions for crypto terms in our glossaryLearn about blockchain basics with CMC AlexandriaRead the latest features in our blogATOM has a very specific total supply — 260,906,513 to be exact. Of these, at the time of writing, about 203,121,910 were in circulation. It is worth noting that these cryptocurrencies aren’t mined — instead, they are earned through staking.Two private sales were held in January 2017, followed by a public sale in April of that year. This raised a total of $16 million, which is the equivalent of about $0.10 per ATOM.Breaking down the token distribution, about 80% was allocated to investors, while the remaining 20% was split between two companies: All In Bits and the Interchain Foundation.Cosmos has compared ATOM tokens to the ASICs that are used to mine Bitcoin. As a technical paper written by the Tendermint team explained: “It is a piece of virtualized hardware (economic capital) that you need to obtain in order to participate as a keeper in the network.”As we mentioned earlier, Cosmos uses a proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Validator nodes that stake a higher quantity of ATOM tokens are more likely to be chosen to verify transactions and earn rewards. Nodes that are found to be acting dishonestly are penalized — and they can end up losing the tokens that they had at stake.It is now available across a number of major exchanges — many people choose to buy Cosmos on Binance, Coinbase and OKEx.

		:about "Avalanche is an umbrella platform for launching decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, financial assets, trading and other services.It aims to be something of a global assets exchange, allowing anyone to launch or trade any form of asset and control it in a decentralized manner using smart contracts and other cutting-edge technologies.Developers at Ava Labs claim that Avalanche is the first smart contracts network to offer transaction finalization in under one second as standard.Avalanche launched its mainnet in September 2020. The platform’s native token, AVAX, performs various tasks within Avalanche and also functions as a rewards and payment system for users.Ava Labs has three co-founders, among whom is Emin Gün Sirer, the veteran computer scientist long associated with Bitcoin (BTC) and decentralized networks.Sirer has long been concerned with Bitcoin scaling, and the Avalanche Consensus is a direct follow-on from this research, allowing transaction volumes significantly higher than Bitcoin and competing with the likes of Visa.Like Sirer, fellow co-founders Kevin Sekniqi and Maofan “Ted” Yin are also associated with Cornell University. Sirer is an advisor to Yin, who is undertaking a PhD in computer science.The remainder of the team is made up of computer science, economics, finance and law experts.Avalanche provides decentralized asset trading which anyone can launch and use, and does so with a network which is unique in the digital realm in providing subsecond transaction confirmations.Developers aim to bring together the huge, fragmented and often opaque world of asset trading under one roof, allowing barrier-free access. Developers can create and release all manner of entities from blockchains to digital representations of any asset, and allow them to trade according to any given parameters. These include, for example, mimicking compliance regulations in various jurisdictions.The AVAX token forms the in-house payment method for Avalanche, and is used for fee collection during transactions, as well as for incentives and related purposes. Users can also earn passive income by staking their coins on the network.Check out CMC Alexandria’s deep dive into Avalanche here.Read more about Ethereum 2.0 here.Check out our interview with Emin Gün Sirer here.Want to learn more about Bitcoin (BTC) or other cryptocurrencies? Check out CoinMarketCap’s dedicated guide here.AVAX has a maximum capped supply of 720,000,000 (720 million) tokens. The genesis block contained half of that supply.The other half will be released according to an emission curve detailed in the Avalanche whitepaper. A key difference to the emission of Bitcoin — which is unalterable — is that the AVAX release rate can be changed by community consensus. The supply cannot be changed all that can differ from consensus is the rate at which the supply cap is reached.In another contrast to Bitcoin and many other networks, transaction fees are “burnt” in order to increase token scarcity. This process is offset by the release, or “minting,” of new coins.Transaction fees themselves vary according to the type of operation that the AVAX transaction is performing on the Avalanche network. Avalanche is a proof-of-stake (PoS) protocol which rewards users for staking coins. PoS networks have come under fire for their low attack cost, which in some cases has exposed serious vulnerabilities.According to Ava Labs, Avalanche gets around this by changing governance to make it all but impossible for an attacker to covertly gain the necessary consensus.AVAX is a freely-exchangeable token and has made its way to major exchanges including Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global.If you’re new to cryptocurrency, you can read more about how to buy Bitcoin or any other token here." ;

		:about "Self-described as Polkadots wild cousin, Kusama is an experimental blockchain platform that is designed to provide a massively interoperable and scalable framework for developers.Kusama is built on Substrate — a blockchain building kit developed by Parity Technologies. Kusama has almost the same codebase as Polkadot — one of the most successful interoperable blockchains.By deploying on Kusama, fast-paced projects gain access to a highly scalable, interoperable sharded network, with features that are not yet available on Polkadot. To that end, Kusama describes itself as a “canary network.”The platform is designed to provide a testbed for developers looking to innovate and deploy their own blockchain and can be used as a preparatory network before launching on Polkadot — though many projects opt to stick with Kusama for their final product. Kusama benefits from a low barrier to entry for deploying parachains, low bond requirements for validators, and is most commonly used by early-stage startups and for experimentation.Kusama was built by the same team that created Polkadot, a company known as Parity Technologies. Its founder is Dr. Gavin Wood, a world-renowned computer scientist and programmer, who also co-founded Ethereum.Parity Technologies has an extensive team comprised of some of the worlds most successful blockchain engineers, and has over 100 employees in total spread throughout the world. In addition, Kusama is funded by grants from the Web3 Foundation, which was launched to help nurture and steward technologies and applications in the fields of decentralised web software protocols. The Web3 foundation also supports Kusama with research and community development thanks to its growth team. Kusama is unusual among blockchain platforms since it is predominantly built for developers that want to launch bold, ambitious projects, with a fast-evolving pace of development.It is built on a multichain, heterogeneously-sharded design that uses a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus system — an alternative consensus mechanism to the energy intensive proof-of-work (POW) scheme employed by several other blockchains. This system enables it to perform rapid on-chain upgrades without a fork, and support cross-chain message passing (XCMP) to enable communication with other parachains on the Kusama network.Like Polkadot, Kusama features on-chain governance capabilities. This on-chain governance is both decentralized and permission-less, allowing anybody with Kusama (KSM) tokens or parachain tokens to vote on their respective governance proposals, which might include putative upgrades, changes to the protocol, and feature requests. This on-chain governance procedure is roughly four times faster than that offered by Polkadot, with a combined voting and enactment period of just 15 days — leading to the rapid pace of development for projects built on Kusama. The project serves projects that want to hit the ground running, launching updates and improvements without the need to implement a fork to do so — thereby ensuring maximum community cohesion. Read more about Polkadot (DOT) — which is like Kusama (KSM), but enterprise-focused.Check out Ethereum (ETH) — one of Kusama’s major competitors.Brush up on your crypto basics with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Visit the CoinMarketCap blog for the latest news, tips, tricks and market insights.As of November 2020, Kusama has a circulating supply of 8.47 million tokens, and a total supply of 10 million tokens. Unlike some other blockchains, this maximum supply is not fixed. Instead, it increases at an inflation rate of 10% per year. The proportion of KSM that are staked changes how the newly minted KSM tokens (from inflation) are distributed. If exactly half of all KSM are staked, then Kusama validators receive 100% of newly minted tokens, whereas if it is above or below 50%, then some of the inflation rewards will go to the Kusama Treasury.Kusama initially launched as an airdrop to those that participated in Polkadot (DOT) token sale. These were distributed at a 1:1 rate, while those without DOT were able to obtain KSM by using a frictional faucet — this has since been decommissioned. Unlike Polkadot, Kusama has not undergone redenomination to increase its circulating supply.Kusama is built using a nominated proof-of-stake (NPoS) consensus mechanism. This uses a network of nominators (KSM stakers) who elect nodes to participate in the transaction validation process. These nominators receive a fraction of the inflation reward if their nominator is selected on the next rotation. Validators that act dishonestly or dont meet performance requirements can have their stake slashed.Additionally, Kusama uses a simple queuing mechanism based on Merkle trees to resolve cross-chain transactions. Relay chain validators are responsible for moving transactions from the output queue of one parachain to the input queue of the target parachain — this is a secure, trustless process that uses the same validators on each chain to pass the messages. Kusama (KSM) is currently available to trade on dozens of popular exchange platforms, including Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global. The most liquid trade pairs for KSM are currently KSM/USDT, KSM/BTC and KSM/ETH. To learn more about buying cryptocurrencies with fiat, see our comprehensive guide." ;

		:about "Billed as the trust layer of the internet, Hedera Hashgraph is a public network that allows individuals and businesses to create powerful decentralized applications (DApps).It is designed to be a fairer, more efficient system that eliminates some of the limitations that older blockchain-based platforms face — such as slow performance and instability.It was funded through an initial coin offering (ICO) in August 2018 and first launched open access to its mainnet just over a year later in September 2019. As part of the ICO, investors were able to purchase the platform’s native utility token (HBAR) at the lowest possible pricing. The HBAR token has a dual role within the Hedera public network. First and foremost, HBAR the fuel that powers Hedera services, such as smart contracts, file storage and regular transactions. Second, its used to help secure the network, since HBAR users can stake their tokens to assist with maintaining the integrity of the platform. Hedera Hashgraph has two founders: Dr. Leemon Baird and Mance Harmon.Dr. Leemon Baird is credited as the investor of the hashgraph distributed consensus algorithm and currently works as Hederas chief scientist. Prior to founding Hedera Hashgraph, Baird accumulated more than a decade of experience in various computer science and security roles and previously worked as a senior research scientist at the Academy Center by Cyberspace Research. He also holds the position of co-founder and CTO at Swirlds Inc., a platform for building DApps.On the other hand, Mance Harmon is Hedera’s CEO and an experienced technology executive and seasoned entrepreneur. Harmon has around two decades of experience holding executive roles at prominent firms — many of which are in the IT security industry. Like Dr. Leemon Baird, Mance Harmon also holds a second position at Swirlds Inc., as its co-founder and CEO. In addition to the founders, the Hedera leadership team also comprises more than a dozen individuals, many of which have had distinguished careers.Unlike most other cryptocurrency platforms, Hedera Hashgraph isn’t built on top of a conventional blockchain. Instead, it introduces a completely novel type of distributed ledger technology known as a Hashgraph. This technology allows it to improve upon many blockchain-based alternatives in several key areas, including speed, cost, and scalability. Hedera transactions have an average transaction fee of just $0.0001 USD and typically reach finality in under five seconds. Overall, Hedera Hashgraph claims it can handle more than 10,000 transactions per second (TPS) — compared to the around 5-20 for most popular proof-of-work (PoW)-based blockchains.The platform offers several major network services. These include:Check out Ethereum (ETH) — the most popular blockchain for decentralized applications.Check out Polkadot (DOT) — another massively scalable blockchain.Learn about decentralized applications (DApps) with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Have you seen the CoinMarketCap blog?The Hedera Hashgraph token, HBAR, has a maximum total supply of 50 billion units. Out of this, almost seven billion were in circulation as of January 2021 — equivalent to around 14% of the total supply.Hedera publishes regular reports detailing when the next wave of HBAR tokens will be unlocked. These reports can be viewed here. According to Hederas resources, the two project founders each have a coin grant of two billion HBARs, equivalent to 4% of the total supply each. These tokens are vested over a six-year period. Other senior executives at Hedera (that joined prior to 2018) have coin grants of between 250 million and 300 million coins. These tokens are vested over a period that ends in December 2021. According to Hederas Economics Whitepaper (published June 2020), around 17.03 billion HBAR is estimated to be in circulation by 2025 — equivalent to 34% of the total supply.Hedera Hashgraph uses a novel consensus system known as Hashgraph consensus to keep its network secure. This uses a rotating governing council consisting of up to 39 highly diversified organizations that span across up to 11 different industries. These are involved with directing the Hedera codebase, voting on platform decisions and operating the initial nodes on the Hedera public network.Hedera uses a novel form of proof-of-stake (PoS) which allows HBAR users to stake their resources to help protect the network. Right now, all Hedera nodes are managed by either Hedera itself or the governing council members, but there are plans to switch to a permissionless system in the future. Overall, Hederas security setup ensures it achieves asynchronous” Byzantine fault tolerance (ABFT) — meaning it can guarantee both the timing and order of a set of transactions, even if some data is delayed or lost.HBAR is a popular digital asset that is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including Binance, Bittrex and Huobi Global. Some of the more popular HBAR trading pairs include HBAR/USDT, HBAR/BTC and HBAR/ETH, and there are also several fiat trading options for the cryptocurrency, including HBAR/USD, HBAR/KRW and HBAR/INR.For more information about buying cryptocurrencies with fiat, see our comprehensive guide." ;

		:about "The Graph is an indexing protocol for querying data for networks like Ethereum and IPFS, powering many applications in both DeFi and the broader Web3 ecosystem. Anyone can build and publish open APIs, called subgraphs, that applications can query using GraphQL to retrieve blockchain data. There is a hosted service in production that makes it easy for developers to get started building on The Graph and the decentralized network will be launching later this year. The Graph currently supports indexing data from Ethereum, IPFS and POA, with more networks coming soon. To date, over 3,000 subgraphs have been deployed by thousands of developers, for DApps like Uniswap, Synthetix, Aragon, AAVE, Gnosis, Balancer, Livepeer, DAOstack, Decentraland and many others. The Graph usage has been growing at over 50% MoM and hit over 7 billion queries during the month of September 2020. The Graph has a global community, including over 200 Indexer Nodes in the testnet and more than 2,000 Curators in the Curator Program as of October 2020. To fund network development, The Graph raised funds from community members, strategic VCs and influential individuals in the blockchain community including Coinbase Ventures, DCG, Framework, ParaFi Capital, CoinFund, DTC, Multicoin, Reciprocal Ventures, SPC, Tally Capital and others. The Graph Foundation also successfully completed a public GRT Sale with participation from 99 countries (not including the U.S.). To date as of November 2020, The Graph has raised ~$25M. The Graph team includes professionals from the Ethereum Foundation, OpenZeppelin, Decentraland, Orchid, MuleSoft leading up to the IPO and acquisition by Salesforce, Puppet, Redhat and Barclays.The initial co-founding team includes Yaniv Tal (project lead), Brandon Ramirez (research lead) and Jannis Pohlmann (tech lead). The founders have engineering backgrounds and have worked together for 5-8 years. Tal and Ramirez studied electrical engineering at USC and worked together at MuleSoft, an API developer tools company that underwent an IPO and sold to SalesForce. They previously co-founded a developer tools startup together and have spent a significant portion of their careers working to optimize the API stack. At their last startup, the founders built a custom framework on an immutable database called Datomic. The Graph was born from this vision to create immutable APIs and data access, using the GraphQL query language.The Graph is working to bring reliable decentralized public infrastructure to the mainstream market. To ensure economic security of The Graph Network and the integrity of data being queried, participants use Graph Token (GRT). GRT is a work token that is locked-up by Indexers, Curators and Delegators in order to provide indexing and curating services to the network.GRT will be an ERC-20 token on the Ethereum blockchain, used to allocate resources in the network. Active Indexers, Curators and Delegators can earn income from the network proportional to the amount of work they perform and their GRT stake. Indexers earn indexing rewards (new issuance) and query fees, while Curators earn a portion of query fees for the subgraphs they signal on. Delegators earn a portion of income earned by the Indexer they delegate to. For more information about cryptocurrencies, check out CMC’s educational portal, Alexandria.Curious about the latest crypto news? Read CMC’s blog!Total GRT supply at mainnet launch will be 10 billion tokens, with an initial circulating supply of ~1,245,666,867 GRT. New token issuance in the form of indexing rewards will begin at 3% annually and is subject to future technical governance by The Graph Council. You can read about GRT token economics here and distribution information here. The Graph has built an open data layer on top of blockchains: Indexers can run their own Ethereum archive nodes to run Graph Node, or they can use node operators like Infura or Alchemy. Any analytics company can build an application to query subgraph data that’s indexed by The Graph. Subgraphs are open APIs to be able to pull data from the blockchain in the most seamless and efficient way." ;

		:about "BitTorrent is a popular peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing and torrent platform which has become increasingly decentralized in recent years. Originally released in July 2001, BitTorrent was purchased by blockchain platform TRON in July 2018. Since its acquisition, BitTorrent has added various new tools, with a dedicated native cryptocurrency token, BTT, released in February 2019. BTT was launched on TRON’s own blockchain, using its TRC-10 standard.According to its official literature, BitTorrent is currently the “largest decentralized P2P communications protocol” in the world.The original BitTorrent is the brainchild of Bram Cohen, a developer and entrepreneur who himself has since become well known in the cryptocurrency arena.Cohen has explained that he designed BitTorrent to usurp the dated entertainment industry, which made obtaining material slow and expensive. The platform has seen multiple legal battles, with Cohen maintaining that it does not break copyright laws in allowing users to share files such as music and movies among themselves.In 2018, TRON completed its acquisition of BitTorrent, bringing BitTorrent under the control of Justin Sun. Sun is notorious for his plugging of both TRON as a cryptocurrency and its blockchain technology, bidding $4.5 million at a charity auction to have lunch with Warren Buffett (well-known anti-crypto figure) and discuss cryptocurrency with him.TRON is also behind the addition of cryptocurrency to BitTorrent, as the BTT token was released on TRON’s blockchain. The move formed part of TRON’s efforts to add further decentralized features to the platform. BitTorrent’s original goal was to disrupt the legacy entertainment industry and how consumers obtain content. Expensive and inefficient distribution networks were the main target, with original developer Bram Cohen seeing benefits in allowing internet users to distribute content among themselves directly.In the early 2000s, BitTorrent became the go-to P2P file sharing platform, with TRON stepping in 2018. Under TRON, BitTorrent has expanded its user appeal to those interested in decentralized solutions and cryptocurrency, as well as to its own user base. Among the added features are BitTorrent Speed, which uses the BTT token as part of its operations.BitTorrent has also branched out into paid services, offering several “premium” versions of its platform which include VPN capabilities and ad-free browsing.Read more about Upfiring here.Read more about AXEL here.New to crypto? Find the answers to all your questions on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.BTT is BitTorrent’s native cryptocurrency, issued on TRON’s blockchain as a TRC-10 standard token. The total supply, as stated in its whitepaper, is 990,000,000,000 BTT. 6% of that total was available in a public token sale, 2% in a private token sale and 9% in a seed sale.Another 20.1% are reserved for airdrops, which are set to occur at various points until 2025. The BitTorrent team and umbrella organization, the BitTorrent Foundation, were awarded 19% of the supply. The TRON foundation holds 20%, with 19.9% going to the BitTorrent ecosystem itself.A final 4% of tokens are reserved for partnership activities.BTT plays various roles in BitTorrent’s products, including allowing users to pay others for faster downloads with BitTorrent Speed.BitTorrent says that it employs “the highest level of security measures” in order to secure user funds, but advises that cryptocurrency involves inherent risk.The company recommends that users protect themselves against theft, in the form of malware or similar programs, by using options such as biometric verification.BTT is tradable for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and even fiat currencies on major exchanges. Binance, Huobi Global and OKEx are among the offerings. To find out more about how to buy Bitcoin (BTC) or any other cryptocurrency, read CoinMarketCap’s easy guide." ;

		:about "THORCHain is a decentralized liquidity protocol that allows users to easily exchange cryptocurrency assets across a range of networks without losing full custody of their assets in the process. With THORChain, users can simply swap one asset for another in a permissionless setting, without needing to rely on order books to source liquidity. Instead, market prices are maintained through the ratio of assets in a pool (see automated market maker).The native utility token of the THORChain platform is RUNE. This is used as the base currency in the THORChain ecosystem and is also used for platform governance and security as part of THORChains Sybil resistance mechanisms — since THORChain nodes must commit a minimum of 1 million RUNE to participate in its rotating consensus process. THORChain was funded through an initial DEX offering (IDO) which launched through the Binance DEX in July 2019. Its mainnet originally launched in January 2021, but a multi-chain upgrade is currently scheduled for 2021.According to an official representative of THORChain, the platform has no CEO, no founder and no directors. Instead, the further development of the platform is organized through Gitlab.On top of this, those currently working on the project are largely anonymous. Again, an official representative of THORChain states that this is to protect the project and ensure that it can decentralize.A tweet by the project sheds some light on the theory behind maintaining a project with an anonymous team, as quoted below:“-> Developers work for the Nodes, by shipping code that makes the system more valuable. -> Nodes work for the Stakers, by securing assets and being online.-> Stakers bring capital, placed on-market for the Swappers.-> Swappers pay fees, bringing economic activity.”THORChain uses a unique system to help mitigate the issue of “impermanent losses” — or the often temporary losses that a liquidity provider can experience when contributing to liquidity pools. It achieves this by using a slip-based fee to help ensure liquidity stays where it is needed.On top of this, THORChain combines a range of novel technologies, including on-way state pegs, a state machine, the Bifröst Signer Module and a TSS protocol to seamlessly facilitate cross-chain token swaps. This is all kept behind the scenes, making the platform accessible to even inexperienced traders. The platform isnt profit-oriented. All fees generated by the protocol go directly to the users, and there are no provisions for the team. Instead, the team is incentivized by simply holding RUNE — just like everyone else.The RUNE token is currently available on multiple blockchains, including Binance Chain (as a BEP-2 token) and Ethereum (as an ERC-20 token). Check out Uniswap (UNI) — the governance token for the popular Uniswap AMM.Check out 1inch (1INCH) — the native token for the 1inch DEX aggregator.How Decentralized Are Decentralized Networks? Find out with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Have you seen the CoinMarketCap blog yet?As of February 2021, there are 158.4 million RUNE in circulation out of a total supply of 500 million.As we touched on earlier, THORChain initially launched following an IEO on the Binance DEX. As part of the IEO, 20 million RUNE were sold. Prior to this, a total of 130 million RUNE were sold in earlier funding rounds. According to the official Binance DEX proposal, 10% of the total supply (50 million tokens) was allocated to the team, and locked until the launch of the mainnet — unlocking at 20% per month thereafter.THORChain currently has an emission curve starting at 30% APR. This is scheduled to target around 2% APR after ten years. THORChain is built using the Cosmos SDK and is powered by the Tendermint consensus mechanism. This keeps the network safe from attacks through a novel BFT proof-of-stake (PoS) system that sees a large number of validators work together to propose and finalize blocks of transactions. Beyond this, THORChain’s smart contracts have been audited by several third-party security firms, including one by Certik — which found no vulnerabilities. RUNE is a popular cryptocurrency that is available to purchase and trade on a large number of both centralized and decentralized exchange platforms. The most prominent of these are Binance (centralized) and SushiSwap (decentralized). As of February 2021, the vast majority of RUNE trading pairs are crypto/crypto pairs. However, RUNE can be bought with Korean won (KRW) on ProBit Exchange and US dollars (USD) on FTX. For more on buying cryptocurrencies with fiat, see our popular guide." ;

		:about "TrueUSD is a U.S. dollar stablecoin pegged to USD at 1:1. First launched to a limited investor base in January 2018, TrueUSD has since grown to incorporate almost $400 million of backed tokens as of October 2020.TrueUSD is one of a number of cryptocurrency stablecoins administered by TrustToken, a platform for tokenizing real-world assets.As with other stablecoins, TrueUSD aims to facilitate increased liquidity and provide cryptocurrency traders and general users with a nonvolatile asset relative to free-floating tokens such as Bitcoin (BTC).As of October 2020, TUSD is the 38th largest cryptocurrency by market cap. TrueUSD is a stablecoin launched by parent company TrustToken, whose co-founder and CEO is Rafael Cosman.Cosman has a lifelong attachment to cryptography, studying it along with artificial intelligence (AI) before working at both Google Brain and software company Palantir. He left Google to create TrustToken in 2017.Cosman has stated that TrueUSD was always just the start of TrustToken’s product line, involving relatively little work in return for creating a high-impact asset. At the time of launch, he noted that regular auditing of the stablecoin formed an important focus for the company, giving investors peace of mind at a time when many cryptoassets were seeing heavy volatility in the wake of the initial coin offering (ICO) phenomenon.TrueUSD aims to balance stability and utility — the main use cases of any stablecoin — with security in the form of regular attestations. From its launch onwards, parent company TrustToken has sought to underscore the importance of independent verification of the stablecoin’s provenance. As such, the stablecoin’s appeal is geared towards larger investors looking to reduce risk, in addition to smaller private traders.TrustToken describes TUSD as “the first regulated stablecoin fully backed by the US Dollar.”TrueUSD is part of an ever-expanding stablecoin market, which now includes a large number of USD-backed assets. Tether (USDT) remains by far the largest, with a market cap of $15 billion as of October 2020, compared to TUSD’s $382 million.TrustToken has entered various corporate partnerships as part of its business activities, including options for TUSD holders to increase annualized passive income returns.Learn more about Tether here.Learn more about USD Coin here.New to cryptocurrency? Find all the information you need with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.There was around 381.9 million TUSD in circulation as of October 2020. Given its status as a stablecoin, the supply is uncapped, and will continue to expand according to demand.There are two incarnations of TUSD available: an ERC-20 token on Ethereum and another, also known as TUSDB, a BEP-2 token on Binance Chain.TrueUSD’s equivalent redeemability for USD is maintained via partnerships with banks and fiduciary entities.TrustToken aims to deliver maximum transparency using tools such as real-time auditing of TUSD’s backing and reliability. Beyond trusting the validity of its USD peg, any security issues relate to those which affect all ERC-20 standard tokens. Transactions, for example, can suffer from abnormally high fees if gas prices on the Ethereum blockchain spike.As one of the largest USD stablecoins, TUSD is freely available on major exchanges, with pairs for cryptocurrencies and other stablecoins available.Among the largest volume currently belongs to Binance and DeFi automated market maker Curve.New to crypto?

		:about "Decred (DCR) is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency launched in February 2016. The Decred token and protocol were created to facilitate open governance, community interaction, and sustainable funding policies. According to the official whitepaper, Decred was created in such a way that the community approves all transactions and changes made regarding the protocol. Hence, there is no way for big Decred holders to manipulate the operation of the protocol. Decred was heavily influenced by Bitcoin and utilized many of the underlying principles of the original cryptocurrency.The main driving force behind the creation of Decred is an enterprise called Company 0. Its mission is to use the capabilities of blockchain technology to create better personal data protection and to bring organizational liberty to projects. Jake Yocom-Piatt is the founder and CEO of Company 0. Currently, he is serving as a project lead for the Decred project. His involvement with cryptocurrency and blockchain technology spans over more than ten years. Code written by Jake Yocom-Piatt has been used in the composition of several Bitcoin-related projects, including the creation of Lightning Network Daemon.Marco Peereboom is the chief technical officer of Company 0. He is the direct supervisor of several teams on the Decred project, including development, security, and infrastructure. Mr. Peereboom’s career includes positions in companies like Dell, where he was a Senior Architect. He has been at Company 0 for more than five years, and his involvement with the Decred project is essential for the successful launch of the cryptocurrency. Decred is an innovative project because it bets on blockchain technology’s decentralized nature to prevent monopoly over voting status in the project itself. One of the main goals of the Decred protocol is to ensure that all DCR holders have the same amount of decision-making power and that large institutions cannot swing the votes in their favor. By introducing ticket-holder voting, Decred ensures that people who have enough DCR will have the opportunity to participate in votes regarding the company/token’s future and operations. Decred also created a dedicated voting platform called Politeia, which allows users to participate in votes, submit proposals and start discussions.Not only that, but to ensure those voting rights, Decred is employing a hybrid consensus mechanism, which combines both the proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake model (PoS). Find out more about XRP.Check out Curve DAO Token.Learn more about Decentralized networks.Read more on the CoinMarketCap blog.Decred plans to issue a total of 21,000,000 tokens. Currently, about 60% of these tokens have entered circulation. Of the 21 million tokens, 8% were mined before the launch of the protocol. Half of these pre-mined coins went towards an initial airdrop, while the other half was distributed to cover costs acquired by Company 0 during the development of the protocol. The initial airdrop was designed to reward interested parties by giving them free Decred (DCR) tokens. Tokens were distributed among participants who had registered for the airdrop event beforehand.Decred uses a hybrid PoW/PoS consensus mechanism, which combines features of the two most popular consensus models. The cryptocurrency uses proof-of-work (PoW) to mine new blocks on the blockchain however, miners receive only 60% of the reward after a successful mining operation.The proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus is used in the voting organization, and it allows users to participate in the ticket-holder voting system. Voters employing the PoS consensus receive 30% of the block reward.The remaining 10% of block rewards are stored in the Decred Treasury. Decred hosts frequent Politeia discussions and votes on how the funds from the Decred Treasury should be spent. The largest marketplace for Decred (DCR) is Binance, with a DCR/BTC trade volume of USD 2,493,254. Binance is also the most popular cryptocurrency exchange for DCR/USDT transactions.Other good options for trading Decred include Huobi Global, YoBit, BitAsset and OKEx. It is important to note that trading cryptocurrency involves risks, like any other investment. Read more here about how to buy cryptocurrencies." ;

		:about "Zcash is a decentralized cryptocurrency focused on privacy and anonymity. It uses the zk-SNARK zero-knowledge proof technology that allows nodes on the network to verify transactions without revealing any sensitive information about those transactions.Contrary to a common misunderstanding, the majority of cryptocurrencies on the market, including Bitcoin (BTC), are not anonymous, but rather pseudonymous while they do not explicitly reveal the identities of their users, each user has their own public address or addresses which can be traced back to them via the methods of data science and blockchain forensics.Zcash transactions, on the other hand, still have to be relayed via a public blockchain, but unlike pseudonymous cryptocurrencies, ZEC transactions by default do not reveal the sending and receiving addresses or the amount being sent. There is an option, however, to reveal this data for the purposes of auditing or regulatory compliance.Zcash was first released on October 28, 2016, and it was originally based on Bitcoin’s codebase.Zcash was founded in 2016 by cypherpunk, computer security expert and entrepreneur Zooko Wilcox-OHearn. He is also the founder of the for-profit Electronic Coin Company (ECC), which manages the development of Zcash.Wilcox-O’Hearn has spent more than 25 years in the industry of cryptography and information security and has contributed to a number of projects, including the now-defunct electronic money firm DigiCash, peer-to-peer data storing software Mojo Nation and the Tahoe Least-Authority File Store filesystem.He also founded Least Authority Enterprises, a technology company focused on improving digital security and preserving the fundamental right to privacy, and co-invented the BLAKE3 cryptographic hash function.Zcash’s main advantage lies in its optional anonymity, which allows for a level of privacy unattainable with regular, pseudonymous cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum.ZEC transactions can be sent in two ways: transparent and shielded. Transparent transactions work in about the same way as in Bitcoin, whose codebase Zcash was originally based on: they are sent between public addresses and are recorded on an immutable public ledger (the blockchain). All essential information about these transactions is available online for anyone to see, including the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent.These public transactions do not reveal user identities in an overt manner: the only identifiers an outside observer can access from the blockchain are public addresses. However, through the efforts of data scientists and law enforcement over recent years, the methods of blockchain analysis have been developed to the point where an interested party can fairly reliably connect a public address on a blockchain to the real-world identity of its owner, essentially making private transactions impossible.Shielded ZEC transactions, on the other hand, leverage the technology of zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge, or zk-SNARKs, in order to enable completely anonymous transactions to be sent over a public immutable blockchain. The fact that the transaction has happened is recorded on the ledger, but the sending and receiving addresses and the amount sent is not revealed to the public.This allows Zcash to offer its users the right to privacy while still enjoying the advantages of a decentralized, permissionless digital currency.Read about Monero, another anonymous cryptocurrency that uses ring signatures and stealth addresses to improve user privacy.Check out more crypto educational information on CMC Alexandria.Find topical crypto stories on CMC’s blog.Overall, Zcash tokenomics is similar to that of Bitcoin: it is a scarce mineable token with a total supply limit of 21 million coins.New ZECs are created in the form of “block subsidies”: whenever a new block is mined and added to the end of the blockchain, a certain amount of coins is minted and split into “miner subsidy” and “founders’ reward” at a ratio of 80 to 20 percent respectively. The block subsidy is halved at regular intervals to slow down the issuance rate as the total supply of ZEC approaches its limit of 21 million.The miner subsidy goes to the miner who has mined the latest block and the founders’ reward is distributed between Electronic Coin Company (ECC) founders, Zcash Foundation and ECC itself, as well as its employees. As of October 2020, the block subsidy is equal to 6.25 ZEC.Zcash network is secured by the proof-of-work SHA-256 hash function which belongs to the SHA-2 set of algorithms — same as Bitcoin.Zcash is a high-ranking cryptocurrency. It is possible to buy Zcash on a number of major exchanges, some of which are:" ;

                           :Coin ;
		:about "Compound is a DeFi lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies by depositing them into one of several pools supported by the platform. When a user deposits tokens to a Compound pool, they receive cTokens in return. These cTokens represent the individual’s stake in the pool and can be used to redeem the underlying cryptocurrency initially deposited into the pool at any time. For example, by depositing ETH into a pool, you will receive cETH in return. Over time, the exchange rate of these cTokens to the underlying asset increases, which means you can redeem them for more of the underlying asset than you initially put in — this is how the interest is distributed. On the flip side, borrowers can take a secured loan from any Compound pool by depositing collateral. The maximum loan-to-value (LTV) ratio varies based on the collateral asset, but currently ranges from 50 to 75%. The interest rate paid varies by borrowed asset and borrowers can face automatic liquidation if their collateral falls below a specific maintenance threshold.Since the launch of the Compound mainnet in September 2018, the platform has skyrocketed in popularity, and recently passed more than $800 million in total locked value. Compound was founded in 2017 by Robert Leshner and Geoffrey Hayes, both of whom previously worked in high-profile roles at Postmates — an online food delivery service. The two continue to hold executive positions at Compound Labs, Inc — the software development firm behind the Compound protocol, with Leshner currently serving as CEO, while Hayes is the CTO.Though both founders have experience founding successful companies, Robert Leshner, in particular, has been particularly active in helping to grow the blockchain space, and has publicly invested in popular crypto platforms including Argent Wallet, Opyn, and Blockfolio. The Compound team now comprises over a dozen individuals — almost half of which work as engineers.According to Compound, the majority of cryptocurrencies sit idle on exchange platforms, doing nothing for their holders. Compound looks to change this with its open lending platform, which allows anybody who deposits supported Ethereum tokens to easily earn interest on their balance or take out a secured loan — all in a completely trustless way. Compound’s community governance sets it apart from other similar protocols. Holders of the platform’s native governance token — COMP — can propose changes to the protocol, debate and vote whether to implement changes suggested by others — without any involvement from the Compound team. This can include choosing which cryptocurrencies to add support for, adjusting collateralization factors, and making changes to how COMP tokens are distributed.These COMP tokens can be bought from third-party exchanges or can be earned by interacting with the Compound protocol, such as by depositing assets or taking out a loan. Learn about Aave — one of Compounds biggest competitors.Read about yearn.finance — one of the first yield farming protocols.Want to brush up on your crypto knowledge? Check out CMC Alexandria.Read our blog to stay up to date with the latest industry news and events.Like many digital assets, only a fixed number of COMP tokens will ever come into existence. The total supply is capped at 10 million COMP and as of writing, less than a third are in circulation (~3.3 million). Out of these 10 million tokens, just over 4.2 million tokens will be distributed to Compound users over a 4-year period. The second biggest allotment (almost 2.4 million COMP) goes to the Compound Labs, Inc shareholders, whereas 2.2 million tokens will be distributed to the Compound founders and current team with a 4 year vesting schedule. Finally, 775,000 COMP are reserved for community governance incentives and the remaining 332,000 tokens will be allocated to future team members. The exact rate of COMP emission is subject to change over time, as voters are able to increase or reduce the emission rate by passing a proposal through community governance. Everything on Compound is handled automatically by smart contracts, which act to mint cTokens after Ethereum and ERC20 assets are deposited, and allow Compound users to redeem their stake using their cTokens. The protocol enforces a collateralization factor for all assets supported by the platform, ensuring each pool is overcollateralized at all times. If the collateral falls below the minimum maintenance level, it will be sold to liquidators at a 5% discount, paying down some of the loan and returning the remainder to an acceptable collateralization factor. This arrangement helps to ensure borrowers maintain their collateral levels, provides a safety net for lenders, and creates an earning opportunity for liquidators. COMP is currently available to trade on hundreds of cryptocurrency exchange platforms, including Coinbase Pro, Binance and Huobi Global. It can be traded against most other popular cryptocurrencies, as well as a range of fiat currencies, including the U.S. dollar (USD), Indian rupee (INR) and Australian dollar (AUD).Not sure how to convert fiat to cryptocurrencies like COMP?

		:about "Waves is a multi-purpose blockchain platform which supports various use cases including decentralized applications (DApps) and smart contracts.Launched in June 2016 following one of the cryptocurrency industry’s earliest initial coin offerings (ICO), Waves initially set out to improve on the first blockchain platforms by increasing speed, utility and user-friendliness. The platform has undergone various changes and added new spin-off features to build on its original design. Waves’ native token is WAVES, an uncapped supply token used for standard payments such as block rewards. Waves is synonymous with its founder, Ukrainian-born scientist Alexander Ivanov (also known as Sasha Ivanov).Prior to creating Waves, Ivanov was already active in the cryptocurrency space, having released the now-defunct instant exchange Coinomat and indexing site Cooleindex. He also created an early version of a stablecoin, CoinoUSD, tied to the U.S. dollar.Ivanov is publicly active in his promotion of Waves, giving frequent interviews on the platform and trends in the wider blockchain industry.According to Waves’ marketing literature, the company now employs over 180 people at locations including Moscow and Switzerland. As one of the first offerings in its field, Waves set out to improve on the early blockchain platforms and products. From the outset, it aimed to appeal to prospective business clients looking to use blockchain to improve processes or create new services.Waves supported smart contract and DApp development, ensuring that speeds and ease-of-use surpassed competition at the time. Since then, other products have appeared, including Gravity, a cross-chain and oracle network, and decentralized finance (DeFi) focused platform Neutrino. Waves DEX is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange.In 2020, Waves announced that its platform would be interoperable with the Ethereum network by releasing the WAVES token as an ERC-20 standard asset. Learn more about Ethereum (ETH) here.Learn more about Cardano (ADA) here.New to crypto? Find out everything you need to know with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.WAVES began as a fixed-cap token for the Waves platform with 100 million tokens available. In its ICO — which raised 30,000 BTC — 85% of the supply went to sale participants, 4% to partners and supporters, 9% to the developers and 1% each to early supporters and bounty schemes which occurred after the ICO.Its utility increased in time, and in 2019, it was decided to remove the supply cap, with decision-making transferred to network participants.Currently, the block reward is 6 WAVES, and any changes come in the form of votes — users must choose whether or not to decrease the block reward by 0.5 WAVES every 110,000 blocks.Waves uses a modified proof-of-stake algorithm called WavesNG. The technology is based on Bitcoin-NG, a scaling proposal by well-known Bitcoin advocate, Cornell University developer Emin Gün Sirer.Waves highlights that its code is open source, allowing for more trust and ease of maintenance than closed source enterprise blockchain solutions. WAVES, as a cryptocurrency on the market for over four years, is widely tradable on a large number of exchanges. Pairs operate between WAVES and other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies. Volumes are highly distributed, with Binance and Huobi Global among the largest market venues.Cryptocurrency newbie? Read our easy guide to buying Bitcoin or any other token." ;

		:about "Dash is an open-source blockchain and cryptocurrency focused on offering a fast, cheap global payments network that is decentralized in nature. According to the projects white paper, Dash seeks to improve upon Bitcoin (BTC) by providing stronger privacy and faster transactions.Dash, whose name comes from digital cash, was launched in January 2014 as a fork of Litecoin (LTC). Since going live, Dash has grown to include features such as a two-tier network with incentivized nodes, including masternodes, and decentralized project governance InstantSend, which allows for instantly settled payments ChainLocks, which makes the Dash blockchain instantly immutable and PrivateSend, which offers additional optional privacy for transactions.Dash was founded by software developers Evan Duffield and Kyle Hagan. The project was originally called XCoin, changing its name to Darkcoin two weeks later before rebranding again to Dash in March 2015 in an effort to positively change its image.Before launching Dash, Duffield was a software developer with experience in finance, from his time working at Hawk Financial Group, as well as in public relations, having developed machine learning algorithms and search engines. He first conceived of Dash in 2012 as a way to add more anonymity to Bitcoin — hence, originally calling it Darkcoin. Duffield has claimed that he started it as a hobby, coding it in just one weekend. Duffield served as CEO of Dash Core Group — the company that supports the continued development, integrations and other activities of Dash — until December 2017 when he stepped down to focus on other strategic initiatives.Hagan co-authored the original Darkcoin whitepaper alongside Duffield. However, he left the project early on in December 2014.According to its website, the goal of Dash is to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused cryptocurrency in the world. To accomplish this, the project relies on a network of masternodes, which are servers backed by collateral held in Dash that are designed to provide advanced services securely and governance over Dashs proposal system. In exchange for part of the block rewards, masternodes provide a second layer of services to the network. They facilitate functions such as InstantSend, PrivateSend and ChainLocks.Dash is marketed to both individual users and institutions, including merchants, financial services, traders and those who need to send international remittances. In October 2020, Dash Core Group reported that its strategic objectives moving forward include building its ecosystem and brand, ensuring that users are satisfied and further advancing the technology behind the network.Dashs governance system, or treasury, distributes 10% of the block rewards for the development of the project in a competitive and decentralized way. This has allowed the creation of many funded organizations, including Dash Core Group. In addition, the Dash Foundation, which advocates for the adoption of the cryptocurrency, receives donations and offers paid individual and institutional memberships.Learn more about Litecoin, the cryptocurrency from which Dash was forked.Learn about XRP, another cryptocurrency offering a near-instant payments networkWant tips on keeping your Dash safe? Read an in-depth crypto safety guide on Alexandria, CoinMarketCaps online educational resource.Stay up to date on the latest cryptocurrency news with the CoinMarketCap Blog.The maximum number of Dash tokens that can be issued is 18,921,005. However, this figure ultimately depends on how the governance decides to allocate the 10% of block rewards reserved for budget proposals. If none were ever allocated, only 17,742,696 DASH would ever be emitted. New Dash tokens are created through a proof-of-work mining algorithm in which the token emission rate is decreased by one-fourteenth, or approximately 7%, every 210,240 blocks, or about every 383 days.Approximately 45% of new DASH is awarded to miners, 45% to masternodes and 10% to fund future proposals. In August 2020, a proposal was approved that will, once in effect, change the ratio of coins awarded to miners and masternodes from 50/50 to 40/60, respectively.Within the first 48 hours of Dashs launch, approximately 2 million coins were mined, which significantly exceeded the planned emission schedule. Dash was originally forked from Litecoin, which suffered a similar issue at its launch due to a bug in its difficulty adjustment algorithm. While it is well-documented that Dash inherited the bug from Litecoin, there has, nonetheless, been widespread speculation about whether the resulting fastmine was intentional to benefit early miners.Dash uses a two-tier network to secure its transactions. The first tier consists of nodes that carry out mining operations under a proof-of-work consensus protocol, meaning that they compete to solve complex cryptographic problems and at least 51% of nodes must approve a transaction for it to be added to the blockchain. The PoW algorithm used by Dash is called X11 — a custom hashing algorithm developed by Dash founder Duffield that uses a sequence of 11 hashing algorithms. According to Dashs documentation, X11 is one of the safest and more sophisticated cryptographic hashes in use by modern cryptocurrencies.The second tier consists of masternodes operating under a proof-of-service consensus algorithm in which masternodes are rated based on their history of providing good services to the network. Masternodes oversee the network and have the power to reject new blocks added by nodes if they were approved improperly. They also enable Dashs ChainLocks feature, which increases security because every 12 hours, a rotating group of masternodes observe and confirm all new blocks added to the blockchain. Dashs developers have stated that this protects the network against 51% attacks.As one of the more popular altcoins, Dash can be purchased on most major cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, Coinbase Pro, Huobi Global, Kraken and OKEx. It can be traded against fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether (ETH), and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets.Are you interested in buying Dash or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

		:about "Telcoin (TEL) is an Ethereum-based decentralized crypto established in July 2017 in Singapore to be the bridge between cryptos, blockchain and the telecommunication industry. The project aims to partner with leading names in the telecoms industry like Verizon and AT&T to remove the hassle that exists between billing platforms and mobile money.The main focus of Telcoin is the remittance market, where Western Union is currently the clear leader. Telcoin is partnering with global telecoms and mobile money platforms to provide users with high-speed, low-cost digital remittances to mobile money platforms and e-wallets.Telcoin (TEL) is an ERC-20 token based on the Ethereum blockchain. TEL is used in the telecoin ecosystem for making payments on e-commerce websites.In 2017, Paul Neuner and Claude Eguienta co-founded Telcoin to help users transfer money globally in seconds. Paul Neuner, who serves as the chairman & CEO of Telcoin, has amassed over 12 years in the field of telecommunication before venturing into the world of blockchain.His earliest involvement as a tech entrepreneur in the telecom space starts with Mobius, a startup that provides fraud management services for mobile networks. In 2012, he founded Pangea K.K., a software mobile application development company based in Tokyo, Japan.Before establishing Telcoin, in March 2017, he started Ikou, a mobile app for creating and organizing events. In 2018, he started Sedona, a next-gen telecom fraud management service that focuses on securing sovereign mobile financial services.The main focus of Telcoin is the remittance markets. While there are almost five mobile phones to a bank account in existence, people still queue up to send money from high-cost remittance agents, with Western Union being the largest.Leveraging the power of blockchain, Telcoin is bringing people in the developing world a faster, low-cost alternative to remittance services. To achieve this, Telcoin works with mobile operators and e-wallets globally, allowing them to reach a broad base of users with a contactless service.Like every other decentralized digital asset, Telcoin gives its user complete access to their money via their phones. At will, users can send and receive money from anywhere in the world. The project is also centered around the user, keeping the platform as user friendly and as familiar as possible.Telecom operators that connect to the Telcoin network are immediately able to issue TEL tokens. The network gives incentives the more the TEL token traffic an operator has, the more incentives he gets from the network.The incentivized model of Telcoin offers extremely low fee services that are attractive to end-users but still profitable for networks, according to Telcoin.Find out about Pundi X (NPXS).Does Bitcoin really lift the altcoin market? Find out the connection between both markets..Stay up to date with the crypto market with the CoinMarketCap blog.Telcoin is built on the Ethereum blockchain. At its launch in 2017, 25 percent of the tokens were distributed in crowdsale to investors. Another 15 percent were retained by the Telcoin Team with a 5 percent liquidity fund.The telecom operators incentives described above makes up 50 percent of all the tokens. Community incentives and ongoing developments get on 5 percent of all TEL tokens. The project launched with a fixed amount of TEL tokens. The max tokens on the network are fixed at 100,000,000,000 TEL. Currently, approximately 50 percent of the tokens (50,270,110,195 TEL) have been issued. Telcoin runs on an Ethereum-based blockchain. While it benefits from the security in the decentralization of the network, staking is not yet available on the Telcoin network. There are also no validators on the network instead, it uses a proof-of-concept model. The partners of Telcoin, the telecoms that sign up to integrate TEL, are the equivalent of validators on the PoS blockchains. The telecoms get the rewards on the network.To achieve better security, Telcoin implements multi-signature crypto security or a multisig model. This means that to complete a transaction on the Telcoin network, you would need at least two private keys. Users can set the number of keys required before a transaction is completed.In addition to the proprietary Telcoin wallet, there is also an option of integrating other existing telecom mobile money wallets.Although TEL is a very popular crypto asset, few exchanges provide the facility to purchase TEL tokens against fiat. You can buy TEL tokens against cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).The top exchanges for buying, selling, and trading in Telcoin (TEL) currently are:KuCoinBalancerHitBTCBitbns1inch Exchange, andSimex." ;

		:about "Yearn.finance is an aggregator service for decentralized finance (DeFi) investors, using automation to allow them to maximize profits from yield farming.Its goal is to simplify the ever-expanding DeFi space for investors who are not technically minded or who wish to interact in a less committal manner than serious traders.Launched in February 2020, the service, formerly known as iEarn, has seen huge growth in recent months as new products debuted and developers released in-house token YFI.Yearn.finance is the brainchild of Andre Cronje. After leaving the iEarn project in February 2020, Cronje returned to oversee a rebirth, with new tools emerging and YFI going live in July.Since then, its fortunes have turned around, with assets under total value locked coming in at just over $1 billion as of the end of September 2020. Cronje has a long career in cryptocurrency and has become synonymous with DeFi in particular. He also has positions at smart contract ecosystem Fantom and CryptoBriefing, a resource dedicated to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and crypto media.Yearn.finance set out to simplify DeFi investment and activities such as yield farming for the broader investor sector. The platform makes use of various bespoke tools to act as an aggregator for DeFi protocols such as Curve, Compound and Aave, bringing those who stake cryptocurrency the highest possible yield.New features continue to be rolled out, these aiming, among other things, to help preserve the long-term value of the platform.Yearn.finance makes a profit by charging withdrawal fees, currently 0.5% at the end of September 2020, as well as 5% gas subsidization fees. Due to its governance model, these can technically be changed by consensus at any time. The target market for yearn.finance is investors who do not have the time to study the increasingly complex DeFi phenomenon from scratch, or who wish to optimize their returns.

		:about "Elrond is a blockchain protocol that seeks to offer extremely fast transaction speeds by using sharding. The project describes itself as a technology ecosystem for the new internet, which includes fintech, decentralized finance and the Internet of Things. Its smart contracts execution platform is reportedly capable of 15,000 transactions per second, six-second latency and a $0.001 transaction cost.The blockchain has a native token known as eGold, or EGLD, that is used for paying network fees, staking and rewarding validators.Elrond was first announced in August 2019, and its mainnet went live in July 2020.Elrond was co-founded in late 2017 by brothers Beniamin and Lucian Mincu alongside Lucian Todea as a solution to the problem of blockchain scalability, which they thought to be the most pressing problem facing the industry.Prior to Elrond, Beniamin and Lucian Mincu co-founded MetaChain Capital, a digital asset investment fund, with Beniamin Mincu serving as CEO and Lucian Mincu as chief technology officer. The two also co-founded ICO Market Data, an aggregator of information around initial coin offerings.Beniamin Mincu was also responsible for product, marketing and community for blockchain platform NEM from 2014 to 2015, in addition to being an early investor in projects such as Zilliqa (ZIL), Tezos (XTZ), Brave and Binance. Lucian Mincu has additional experience as an information technology engineer and security specialist, having worked with Uhrenwerk 24, Cetto and Liebl Systems.Todea is a serial tech entrepreneur who previously founded and served as CEO of Soft32, a software review and download site, and a partner of mobilPay, a mobile payments application. He is also an angel investor, having invested in biometrics tech company TypingDNA and accounting platform SmartBill.Elrond describes itself as a blockchain platform for the new internet economy, decentralized applications and enterprise use. Its main selling point is its high scalability, stating that it is the first blockchain network in which state, network and transaction sharding have all been implemented. According to its economics paper, it seeks to build up its ecosystem and establish EGLD as a store-of-value asset.To achieve this goal, the network runs on 2,169 validator nodes split into four shards: three execution shards, capable of 5,400 transactions per second each, and one coordination shard, the Metachain. Elronds adaptive state sharding architecture completely shards state, transactions and network. It can scale by adding an additional shard when the throughput demand is unmet. It was tested to run 263,000 TPS in a public environment with 1,500 nodes from 29 countries grouped in 50 shards.In order to increase adoption, the project also supports developers building on the platform, allowing them to earn 30% of the smart contract fees as royalties.The company maintains a supply of EGLD tokens to stake on the network during its first year, with validator nodes receiving a 36% annual percentage rate.Learn about Zilliqa, another blockchain project that uses sharding to improve scalability.Learn about Harmony, which also uses sharding to scale its blockchain.New to the blockchain space? Read an in-depth introduction on Alexandria, CoinMarketCaps online educational resource.Stay up to date on the latest innovations in blockchain technology with the CoinMarketCap Blog.The Elrond economic model has a limited supply that starts at 20,000,000 EGLD, with new tokens minted to reward network validators. The maximum supply can never exceed 31,415,926 EGLD, but this number will decrease as more transactions are processed.Elronds native token was first made available for purchase through a private sale, in which 19% of its initial supply was sold, with 7.5% made available immediately upon token generation and another 15.41% released every three months. Elrond also held an initial exchange offering on Binance, in which 25% was sold and made available immediately. Of the remaining 56%, 7% was reserved for ecosystem rewards, with 50% released immediately and 50% after six months 8.5% for marketing, grants and an accelerator pool for DApp developers, with 81.17% released immediately and 9.41% every six months 2% for a community fund, with 33.3% released immediately, 33.3% after six months and 33.3% after 12 months 2.5% for advisors, released after one year 19% for Elronds founders and core team members, with 10% released after six months, 10% after 12 months, 15% after 18, 24, 30 and 36, and 20% after 42 months and 17% for the company for ecosystem support, with 33.3% that can only be used for staking during the first year released immediately and 66.6% released in three equal installments over three years, starting after one year.Elronds tokens were first issued on Binance Chain under the name ERD with a total supply of 20 billion. 500 million were burned in November 2019 and minted on the Ethereum blockchain as ERC-20 tokens, and the company launched a token swap event in September 2020 for token holders to swap their ERC-20 and BEP-2 tokens for mainnet EGLD tokens. During the process, the total token supply was reduced from 20 billion to 20 million by setting the swap ratio at 1,000 ERD for 1 EGLD.Elrond uses what it calls a secure proof-of-stake consensus algorithm in which nodes must stake their EGLD tokens to participate in the validation process, and each validator is assigned a rating score based on past activity, which also influences whether or not they are selected. If a validators rating becomes too low, it will not be selected and must pay fines. Validators can also be removed from the network and have their stakes slashed if they continuously act in a manner that is against the integrity of the network.Validators are randomly selected in a way that can be neither predicted nor modified based on the previous round of validations. In addition, validators are periodically shuffled between shards as a way to prevent collusion. Nodes communicate among one another using modified Boneh-Lynn-Shacham, or BLS, multi-signatures for strong cryptographic protection.EGLD can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, OKEx, Bitfinex and BitMax. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and Indonesian rupiah, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance Coin (BNB), and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and Binance USD (BUSD). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets.Are you interested in buying EGLD or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

Launched in July 2019, the Helium mainnet allows low-powered wireless devices to communicate with each other and send data across its network of nodes.Nodes come in the form of so-called Hotspots, which are a combination of a wireless gateway and a blockchain mining device. Users who operate nodes thus mine and earn rewards in Helium’s native cryptocurrency token, HNT.Helium’s goal is to prepare IoT communication for the future, identifying inadequacies in current infrastructure from its birth in 2013.Helium’s three co-founders Amir Haleem, Shawn Fanning and Sean Carey started the company in 2013.Haleem has an active eSports and game development background. Fanning, by contrast, is well known for developing Napster, the music sharing service which was one of the first mainstream peer-to-peer (P2P) internet services in the late 1990s.Carey meanwhile held multiple development roles prior to Helium, which included advertising optimization firm Where, acquired by PayPal.Helium’s team now consists of members which the company says have experience in “radio and hardware, manufacturing, distributed systems, peer-to-peer and blockchain technologies.”Helium aims to improve the communication capabilities of wireless Internet of Things (IoT) devices. In 2013, infrastructure around IoT was still in its infancy, but developers wanted to add decentralization to their offering, hence referring to it as “The People’s Network” in official literature.Its core appeal will be to device owners and those interested in the IoT space, with financial incentives providing further outreach possibilities.Network participants purchase Hotspots — a combination of a wireless gateway and a miner — or build their own. Each hotspot provides network coverage over a certain radius, and also mines Helium’s native token, HNT.The network runs on proof-of-coverage, a new consensus algorithm based on the HoneyBadger BFT protocol which allows nodes in a network to reach consensus when connection quality is highly variable. In addition to HNT, users pay transaction fees in a separate token called Data Credits, which are not exchangeable and tied to individual users themselves.Read more about IOTA here.Read more about IOTW here.Crypto newbie? Find all the answers with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.Approximate mining periods of 30 to 60 minutes unlock rewards which are distributed according to a changing growth plan.Helium explains that at the start, node owners will accrue more HNT for building out network infrastructure, while later on, it will be more advantageous to transfer device data. This adjustment mechanism for token distribution is expected to last for around 20 years.As of the start of October 2020, there are 48,712,218 HNT in circulation. When the token launched, the supply was zero, with no premine.Helium uses a bespoke consensus mechanism called proof-of-coverage (PoC) which rewards users for contributing to mining (validating transactions) and ensuring stability.PoC is based on the HoneyBadger BFT protocol, which is specifically designed for node communication when conditions are unreliable.Helium says that the most likely attack vector impacts node operators in the form of inbound ports of Hotspots. For token holders, the platform’s own wallet uses asymmetric keys to help users with private key security.HNT is a tradable token spreading across major exchanges as of October 2020.

		:about "Holo is a peer-to-peer distributed platform for hosting decentralized applications built using Holochain, a framework for developing DApps that does not require the use of blockchain technology. The goal of Holo is to serve as a bridge between the broader internet and apps built using Holochain, offering an ecosystem and marketplace in which DApps are easily accessible, as they are hosted on the internet by Holo network participants.The Holo network will be facilitated using a token called HoloFuel, which is actively being tested and will act as an accounting system to pay hosts for their services. In 2018, the project minted an ERC-20 token, HOT — also known as HoloToken — as an IOU that will be redeemable for HoloFuel upon launch.Holo is still in development and is expected to launch for open alpha and beta testing by 2021.Holo was founded by Arthur Brock and Eric Harris-Braun, both of whom are experienced contract coders. The two first started working on the project in December 2016 as a part of the MetaCurrency Project, a developer of tools and technology designed to power a future P2P economy. Holo was partially modeled after Ceptr, a cooperative P2P framework for DApps that the two had previously worked on.Brock has prior experience coding alternative currency systems as the founder of Geek Gene, a company that developed community-building tools, including more than 100 alternative currency solutions. He also co-founded social-enterprise incubator Emerging Leader Labs and founded open-source education starter kit Agile Learning Centers. In March 2019, Brock was named a fellow of the New Zealand-based Edmond Hillary Fellowship.Harris-Braun started programming full time in 1988 and is the founder of Glass Bead Software, a developer of peer-to-peer communication software, as well as co-founder of Emerging Leader Labs alongside Brock. In 2003, he co-founded Harris-Braun Enterprises, a freelance software development and consulting firm. He has also served on the advisory board of the Schumacher Center For New Economics.According to its green paper, Holo is designed to act as a bridge between Holochain, which represents the world of crypto technology, and everyday users. The project highlights several innovations that it says will enable a large shift in the landscape of crypto applications and currencies, including the ability to host P2P apps on the internet for mainstream users.The Holo network relies on a series of hosts that provide storage and processing power for DApps built using Holochain. Hosts either install software on their computer that runs in the background and automatically allocates extra processing power to Holochain-based DApps, or they operate a dedicated machine such as a HoloPort. In exchange, hosts are paid in HoloFuel, a token that is specifically designed for microtransactions. The design of HoloFuel is expected to allow the Holo network to process billions of simultaneous transactions.The projects business plan centers on building a P2P ecosystem of hosts and applications, comparing its intended effect on app hosting to that of Uber and Airbnb on the taxi and hotel industries, respectively. Holo charges a fee on HoloFuel transactions, so its revenue model is directly tied to growing the number of applications and hosts on the network.Learn about Ethereum, the most popular platform used by DApps.Learn about Siacoin, the token powering the decentralized cloud storage platform Sia.Want to test out a DApp? Learn how to easily access one from your mobile phone with an in-depth guide on Alexandria, CoinMarketCaps online educational resource.Stay up to date on the latest decentralized platforms and applications with the CoinMarketCap blog.Holo held an initial community offering from March 2018 through April 2018. Ultimately, 177.6 billion HOT was minted through a demand-determined process, with 133.2 billion HOT (75%) allocated for public sale and 44.4 billion HOT (25%) reserved for the team and company. Team tokens were not subject to vesting or lock-up periods.Once HoloFuel is launched, HOT tokens will be able to be swapped at a one-to-one ratio for HoloFuel tokens. In January 2019, Holo stated that instead of being immediately burned, the swapped HOT will instead be kept as a reserve currency to provide liquidity to HoloFuel holders.HoloFuel will have no supply limit. Rather, it is designed to be dynamic and incorporate a credit system, allowing users to have negative balances. The supply will be controlled algorithmically, contracting and expanding in response to demand and as the relationships between users with negative and positive balances change. Holo intends for this to cause the price of its tokens to remain relatively stable from moment to moment, rather than be subject to wild, speculative price swings.The Holo network acts as a bridge between the centralized internet and Holochain, which does not rely on traditional blockchain technology. As such, it does not rely on global consensus to secure its networks. Rather, each DApp has its own set of validation rules and a local hash chain on which it can store cryptographically signed records. When data is transmitted across multiple nodes, random peers act as validators, receiving data and verifying that it follows the correct rules. Validators use a gossip protocol to share good data among one another and warn of bad data or blacklist bad actors.According to its development team, Holo is designed to be as decentralized as possible in order to reduce the risks associated with giving any one entity too much power. The connection between hosts and applications is end-to-end encrypted, and Holo uses a globally distributed network of servers.HOT can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Bitrue, ProBit Exchange and MXC.COM, among others. It can be traded on spot markets against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) and the stablecoin Tether (USDT).Are you interested in buying HOT or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

		:about "SushiSwap (SUSHI) is an example of an automated market maker (AMM). An increasingly popular tool among cryptocurrency users, AMMs are decentralized exchanges which use smart contracts to create markets for any given pair of tokens.SushiSwap launched in September 2020 as a fork of Uniswap, the AMM which has become synonymous with the decentralized finance (DeFi) movement and associated trading boom in DeFi tokens.SushiSwap aims to diversify the AMM market and also add additional features not previously present on Uniswap, such as increased rewards for network participants via its in-house token, SUSHI.SushiSwap was founded by the pseudonymous entity known only as Chef Nomi. Little is known about Chef Nomi, or his or her impetus for forking off from Uniswap.The project has two other pseudonymous co-founders, sushiswap and 0xMaki, also known as just Maki. Between them, they handle SushiSwap’s code, product development and business operations.More recently, de facto ownership of SushiSwap was passed to Sam Bankman-Fried, CEO of derivatives exchange FTX and quantitative trading startup Alameda Research.Bankman-Fried is a well-known participant and cryptocurrency market commentator, regularly appearing in media interviews. SushiSwap primarily exists as an AMM, through which automated trading liquidity is set up between any two cryptocurrency assets.Its main audience is DeFi traders and associated entities looking to capitalize on the boom in project tokens and create liquidity.AMMs do away with order books entirely while avoiding problems such as liquidity issues, which hamper traditional decentralized exchanges.SushiSwap aims to improve on the offerings of its parent, Uniswap, by increasing the impact users can have on its operations and future. The platform takes a 0.3% cut from transactions occurring in its liquidity pools, while its SUSHI token is used to reward users portions of those fees. SUSHI also entitles users to governance rights. Learn more about Uniswap’s distribution on the CMC blog here.New to DeFi? Learn more about it here.Cryptocurrency newbie? Check out Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education suite.SushiSwap’s in-house token SUSHI is created at a rate of 100 tokens per block. The first 100,000 blocks had a block reward of 1,000 SUSHI.The supply of SUSHI will depend on the block rate. At approximately 6,500 per day, and therefore 650,000 newly-minted tokens per day, there will be roughly 326 million tokens in circulation by September 2021, a year after SushiSwap first launched.SUSHI had no premine, and began to be minted at Ethereum block number 10,750,000, beginning with a supply of zero tokens.SushiSwap attempts to mitigate the traditional risks of depositing funds in smart contracts by upping the governance powers of its users.The anonymity of its developers poses questions beyond a technical standpoint. In September 2020, for example, Chef Nomi was involved in a spat with users after withdrawing 38,000 in Ethereum (ETH) from SushiSwap. The funds were subsequently returned, with Chef Nomi publicly apologizing for doing so and calling the move a mistake.SushiSwap (SUSHI) is a freely-tradable token, with the majority of volume on major exchanges occurring on Binance, Huobi Global and OKEx.Pairs against other cryptocurrencies and stablecoins are active, as well as with fiat, including on Bankman-Fried’s FTX exchange.New to cryptocurrency?

		:about "NEM (New Economy Movement) is an ecosystem of platforms that use blockchain and cryptography to provide solutions for businesses and individuals. XEM is the native cryptocurrency of NEM’s NIS1 public blockchain.NIS1 operates in a similar way to Bitcoin (BTC): it has a network of distributed independent nodes that process and record transactions on a public ledger called “blockchain.” These nodes are incentivized to contribute their time and computing resources and remain incorruptible via transaction fee rewards these rewards are paid out in XEM coins to each node that manages to add a new block of transactions to the end of the blockchain.However, NIS1’s blockchain has a number of unique features that set it apart from Bitcoin and most other cryptocurrencies.The alpha version of NIS1 — or NEM as it was known at that time — was launched on June 25, 2014, and its mainnet went live on March 31, 2015.NEM was originally created by three developers known by their pseudonyms on the Bitcointalk.org forum: Jaguar0625, BloodyRookie and gimre. Since its inception in 2014-2015, NEM has grown from a personal project of three programmers to a large ecosystem composed of several platforms.NEM’s overall development and promotion is now managed by NEM Group. NEM Group is a parent company designed to support the growth of the NEM ecosystem leading up to the launch of Symbol (NEM 2.0) and beyond. NEM Group was formed by a team of experienced NEM representatives and enterprise veterans who realized that a simplified structure would benefit the entire ecosystem, while also promoting more community input and engagement. The NEM Group Board of Directors is responsible for setting the strategy and budgets, and ensuring that all subsidiaries are working towards collective objectives. NEM Group comprises three separate entities: NEM Software, focused on the product and business development NEM Trading, responsible for all finances, including liquidity management, exchange support and token lending and NEM Ventures, the venture capital and investment arm, focused on strategic partnerships.XEM is a decentralized open-source cryptocurrency that has a number of unique features.Perhaps the most important of these is the way the NIS1 blockchain is secured. NIS1 uses its own proof-of-importance (PoI) algorithm — as opposed to the far more widespread proof-of-work and proof-of-stake — for the purpose of ensuring that transactions on the network are processed and recorded in a timely and honest manner.Proof-of-importance allows anyone to run a node on the NIS1 network and facilitate transactions via a process called “delegated harvesting.” The system takes into account every node’s amount of already held coins, how often they transact on the network and who they transact with, in order to approximate their “importance score” in NEM’s economy. Based on this score, the nodes then receive a share of the fees from the transactions they have helped to process.NEM claims that the proof-of-importance system ensures that the network can identify and reward those that actually use it the most.In addition to its unique PoI algorithm, NIS1 also supports such features as multisignature account contracts, encrypted messaging, the Eigentrust++ reputation system and the Apostille service for notarizing and checking the authenticity of files on blockchain.Another important market for NIS1 are enterprise-level solutions: through a purpose-built API system, NEM allows developers to integrate its blockchain infrastructure into third-party applications. Learn more about crypto on CoinMarketCap’s new educational platform Alexandria.Check out CMC’s blog.The total supply of XEM is 8.999 billion coins, all of which were created since the launch of the network — no new XEM can be mined. The network nodes are incentivized to process transactions via the distribution of fees on the transactions that are included in each new block.To secure its network, NEM uses Ed25519 public-key signature system and the SHA3 hash algorithm.It is possible to buy XEM or use trading pairs that are available, such as:" ;

		:about "Zilliqa is a public, permissionless blockchain that is designed to offer high throughput with the ability to complete thousands of transactions per second. It seeks to solve the issue of blockchain scalability and speed by employing sharding as a second-layer scaling solution. The platform is home to many decentralized applications, and as of October 2020, it also allows for staking and yield farming.Development work officially started on Zilliqa in June 2017, and its testnet went live in March 2018. A little over a year later, in June 2019, the platform launched its mainnet.The native utility token of Zilliqa, ZIL, is used to process transactions on the network and execute smart contracts.Zilliqa was first conceived by Prateek Saxena, an assistant professor at the National University of Singapore School of Computing. Saxena and several students in the School of Computing published a paper in 2016 that outlined how a sharding-focused blockchain could improve network efficiency and speed.Around the same time, Saxena co-founded Anquan Capital alongside Max Kantelia, a lifelong finance and tech entrepreneur, and Juzar Motiwalla, former president of the Singapore Computer Society. The company incorporated Zilliqa Research in June 2017 to develop the Zilliqa network, bringing on Dong Xinshu as its CEO, Yaoqi Jia as its chief technology officer and Amrit Kumar as its chief scientific officer. All three previously worked as research fellows at the NUS School of Computing.Zilliqa claims to be the worlds first public blockchain to rely entirely on a sharded network. This allows it to achieve high throughput and a high rate of transactions per second, which it says solves the scalability issue. Because each shard processes transactions individually, as the network grows and the number of shards increases, the number of transactions that can be processed per second also increases. As well, records are immediately added to the Zilliqa blockchain after being processed, meaning that no additional time for confirmation is required.Zilliqa seeks to become the blockchain of choice for large-scale enterprise use, including among the advertising, gaming, entertainment and financial services and payments industries. In its 2018 position paper, its team states that the platform aims to rival traditional centralized payment methods such as VISA and MasterCard.Both Anquan Capital and Zilliqa Research, the company responsible for developing Zilliqa, hold significant reserves of ZIL.Learn about the largest blockchain to consider incorporating sharding, Ethereum.Learn about Harmony, another high-throughput, sharded blockchain project.Want to better understand crypto markets? Read CoinMarketCaps in-depth guide on tokenomics.Stay up to date on the ins and outs of crypto with the CoinMarketCap Blog.Zilliqa has a fixed maximum supply of 21 billion tokens. ZIL was first made available for sale as an ERC-20 token as a part of a token generation event that concluded in January 2018. The tokens were subsequently transferred to the Zilliqa mainnet in a token-swap event that concluded in February 2020.Before launching, Zilliqa generated 60% of all tokens (12.6 billion ZIL) to be distributed at the token generation event, and the remaining 40% (8.4 billion ZIL) will be created through the mining process. Ten percent of all tokens (2.1 billion ZIL) were reserved for Anquan Capital, 12% (2.52 billion ZIL) for Zilliqa Research, and 5% for contemporary and future Zilliqa team members — all of which were announced to be distributed quarterly over a three-year period.Zilliqa is designed such that all tokens will be minted within 10 years, with the block mining reward slowly decreasing. According to its whitepaper, the project aims to have 80% of the tokens (16.8 billion ZIL) mined within the first four years and 20% (4.2 billion ZIL) in the remaining six years.The Zilliqa network is secured through a practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance, or pBFT, consensus protocol, meaning that at least two-thirds of all nodes must agree that a record is accurate in order for it to be added to the blockchain. Each Zilliqa blockchain shard relies on a group of nodes to confirm a subsection of all the transactions, and once each shard has reached a consensus, a second group of nodes confirms the shards collective results and adds a new block to the blockchain.The network uses elliptic-curve cryptography to secure its consensus protocol and allows for multisignatures. In addition to the pBFT consensus protocol that secures its transaction records, Zilliqa also uses a proof-of-work algorithm to assign node identities and generate shards.Zilliqa developed a new language, Scilla, for its smart contracts. Short for Smart Contract Intermediate-Level Language, Scilla is a safety-focused language intended to automatically identify and eliminate security vulnerabilities at the language-level and make it easier to formally verify the safety of smart contracts through mathematical proofs.Zilliqas native token, ZIL, is listed on several major cryptocurrency exchanges — including Binance, Huobi, Bitfinex and Bithumb — where it is available to be traded against fiat currencies, stablecoins and other cryptocurrencies.Are you interested in buying ZIL or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC)?

Token holders also receive dividends from Nexos profits.The project was first announced in December 2017, and it launched in April 2018.Nexo was founded by a team of finance professionals and crypto enthusiasts, who turned to blockchain to create the crypto equivalent to a service well established in traditional finance, but hitherto non-existent in digital finance— borrowing against the value of your assets while retaining ownership. In 2018, the team launched the Nexo platform, offering the world’s first crypto credit lines that allowed digital asset holders to obtain fiat and stablecoin loans against their cryptocurrency, and thus setting the foundations of the crypto lending niche. The collective behind Nexo has a combined experience of over 30 years in financial services, including non-crypto lending, investment banking, mergers and acquisitions, and hedge funds, with Co-founder and Managing Partner Antoni Trenchev additionally contributing with experience in Finance Law and in KYC and AML solutions. Trenchev, who has acted as the public face of Nexo’s leadership, has a track record in advocating for wider blockchain and crypto adoption, notably serving as member of parliament in Bulgaria’s National Assembly from 2015 to 2017, where he promoted the implementation of blockchain solutions for e-government services, as well as frequently commenting on crypto and digital finance-related current events to mainstream media, including Bloomberg, The Independent, and CNBC. Nexo currently services over a million users across 200+ jurisdictions, managing over $4 billion in assets. The company currently has 150 employees, with its management based in London.According to its whitepaper, Nexo is the first-ever provider of instant cryptocurrency-backed loans and it intends to solve inefficiencies in the lending market. Its automated lending process uses smart contracts and an oracle on the Ethereum blockchain to manage loans. After a user transfers cryptocurrency to a Nexo-controlled wallet, the oracle establishes the loan and the user is instantly allocated the funds. When the user makes a deposit in order to repay the loan, the oracle returns the cryptocurrency and records the transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts are used to power NEXO and to record user balances.Nexo is marketed to individual and institutional investors, cryptocurrency companies, exchanges, miners and others who want liquidity from their assets. The company makes a profit from the interest accumulated on loans, and it also offers institutional lending and consulting services.Nexo seeks to build a user base of clients that continue to use the platform and remain invested in NEXO. As such, the company announced a loyalty program that rewards those who keep NEXO in their accounts, giving them preferential interest rates on loans and higher yields on savings. Nexo also distributes 30% of its profits to NEXO token holders in the form of dividends.Learn about SALT, another crypto-collateralized lending platform.Learn about Maker, one of the most popular crypto lending platforms.Curious about oracles?

Of this amount, the supply was allocated in the following manner:While Nexo initially planned to have a public presale and main token sale, it later canceled its public sales due to an overwhelming amount of interest from investors in its private sale.In October 2020, the company announced that it was launching a Nexonomics initiative to drive its tokenomics and increase the value of NEXO. The company subsequently revealed that it would buy back $12 million worth of NEXO.Nexo is a privately owned company and, as such, is responsible for the security of its networks and user funds. Nexo stores its digital assets with BitGo, a crypto-asset custodian that keeps tokens in cold storage wallets and is covered by a $100 million insurance policy. In November 2019, Nexo reported that it was ISO/IEC 27001:2013 certified after being audited by RINA and the Consortium for IT Software Quality.Its native token, NEXO, is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that any on-chain NEXO transactions are validated and secured by the Ethereum mainnet using its Ethash proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain, and a majority of all nodes in the network must validate a record for it to be posted.Upon its launch, Nexo reported that its token had been fully audited. In November 2019, the smart contracts were independently audited by Castillo Network, which found no critical security issues.NEXO can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Huobi Global, UPEX, Hoo and Bitrue, among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the South Korean won and the Indian rupee, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), and the stablecoin Tether (USDT).Are you interested in buying NEXO or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

		:about "Enjin Coin is a project of Enjin, a company that provides an ecosystem of interconnected, blockchain-based gaming products. Enjins flagship offering is the Enjin Network, a social gaming platform through which users can create websites and clans, chat, and host virtual item stores.Enjin allows game developers to tokenize in-game items on the Ethereum blockchain. It uses Enjin Coin, an ERC-20 token, to back the digital assets issued using its platform, meaning that items can be bought, sold and traded with real-world value.Enjin Coin was first announced in July 2017, and it launched on the Ethereum mainnet in June 2018.Enjin Coin (ENJ) is a digital store of value used to back the value of blockchain assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs).Every asset minted with the Enjin Platform contains ENJ, a minting resource which is locked inside NFTs and removed from circulation. Minting blockchain assets with ENJ provides a variety of benefits to creators and users:The Enjin blockchain ecosystem aims to offer software products that make it easy for everyone to develop, trade, monetize, and market with blockchain.Founded in 2009, Enjin has roots in the gaming industry, with the company’s first product, a gaming community platform called the Enjin Network, growing to 20 million users over the course of a decade.In 2017 following an ICO, Enjin established itself as a leading blockchain ecosystem developer, building a suite of software products that enable anyone to easily mint, manage, trade, distribute, and integrate blockchain assets.Enjin’s co-founder Witek Radomski wrote the code for one of the first ever non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and is also the co-author of the ERC-1155 Ethereum token standard.Built on top of an on-chain infrastructure, the Enjin ecosystem enables game developers and businesses of all sizes to use tokenized digital assets as part of their acquisition, retention, engagement, and monetization strategies. The Enjin ecosystem is fueled by Enjin Coin (ENJ), a cryptocurrency used to back the value of blockchain assets.Enjin was founded as a gaming community platform in 2009 by Maxim Blagov and Witek Radomski, with Blagov becoming CEO and assuming responsibility for the creative direction of the company and Radomski serving as chief technical officer, responsible for the technical development of its products. Blagov has described himself as having experience in creative direction, marketing, and software project management and design.The idea of introducing blockchain to Enjin was first proposed by Radomski after he became interested in Bitcoin (BTC) in 2012, eventually convincing the company to accept it as a payment option. After learning about Ethereum and smart contracts, he decided he wanted to create his own blockchain-integrated software. Radomski is also the author of the ERC-1155 token standard, a new standard for Ethereum-issued tokens that was introduced in June 2018, finalized in June 2019, and is used for minting both fungible and nonfungible tokens.According to co-founder Radomski, Enjin Coin is unique in that every token minted with Enjin Platform, the companys blockchain asset development platform that launched in February 2020, is directly backed by ENJ, giving in-game items real-world liquidity. Similarly, Blagov has stated that the company is focused on adoption, saying he imagines a future in which millions of gamers use digital items backed by Enjin Coin without even knowing it exists.Enjin Coin uses a series of smart contracts to which game developers send ENJ to mint new, unique fungible or nonfungible ERC-1155 tokens. These tokens can be traded on the Enjin Marketplace, which launched in September 2019, or exchanged for their backing ENJ at any time. As more custom tokens are minted, more ENJ is removed from the ecosystem, thus making it scarcer.According to its whitepaper, Enjin Coin uses a series of both on-chain and off-chain processes. When a transaction is completed within the Enjin ecosystem, a Trusted Platform contacts the users smart wallets, and the website or game is updated immediately with a placeholder or nontradable version of the digital item until the transaction has been validated by the Ethereum blockchain.Learn about Decentraland, a virtual world where land ownership is backed by cryptocurrency.Learn about Atari Token, the cryptocurrency project by iconic video game producer Atari.Want to know more about initial coin offerings? Read an in-depth guide on Alexandria, CoinMarketCaps online educational resource.Stay up to date on how blockchain is disrupting the gaming industry with the CoinMarketCap Blog.Enjin Coin has a fixed maximum supply of 1 billion tokens. However, as the ecosystem grows and more ENJ is locked into in-game digital assets, the number of coins actually circulating will decrease.Enjin Coin was first made available for purchase during a presale event in September 2017 in which 400 million ENJ was sold for a total of 38,800 Ether (ETH), worth $12 million at the time, with another 100 million ENJ given away as bonuses. In total, the presale sold and gave away 50% of the total supply. An initial coin offering was held in October 2017, with 300 million ENJ — 30% of the total supply — available for sale. The ICO raised 75,041 ETH, worth $18.9 million at the time. Tokens that were not sold during the ICO were locked for six months to be later used for community initiatives and marketing.10% of the total token supply was reserved for the company for community initiatives, beta testing, marketing and strategic partnerships, while another 10% was reserved for team members and advisors. Team member tokens were locked for the first six months and vested over a period of 24 months, while advisor tokens were locked for two months and fully released afterward.Enjin Coin is an ERC-20 token issued on the Ethereum blockchain, meaning that any on-chain ENJ transactions are validated and secured by the Ethereum network using a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Miners compete among each other to add new blocks to the blockchain and a majority of all nodes in the network must confirm a record for it to be posted.The underlying smart contracts that power Enjin Coin have undergone several audits, including by Ethereum developer Matthew Di Ferrante in September 2017, smart-contract auditor and developer ZK Labs in early 2018, and Castillo Network in July 2019.In October 2020, Enjin launched a bug bounty program via information security company HackerOne.Enjin Coin can be purchased on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Binance, Bithumb, Uniswap (V2) and Balancer, among others. It can be traded against fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar and the euro, cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ether, and stablecoins such as Tether (USDT) and USD Coin (USDC). It can be bought and sold on both spot and derivatives markets.Are you interested in buying ENJ or other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin?

                           :Coin ;
		:about "MDEX is a new decentralized trading protocol that was only launched in January 2021, but which has already usurped Ethereum’s Uniswap and SushiSwap, Binance Smart Chain’s PancakeSwap and the 1inch exchange in popularity, flippening Uniswap as the number 1 ranked DEX on CoinMarketCap as of March 2021.MDEX is an automated market making (AMM) decentralized exchange protocol that operates on the concept of fund pools, sharing some similarities with standard DEXs, but differentiating itself from competitors by using a dual-chain model modeled on both the Ethereum network and the Huobi Ecological Chain (HECO). This allows it to benefit from both the super-low transaction fees of HECO and deep liquidity of the Ethereum ecosystem.As a trading platform built on top of HECO, MDEX is currently leaving Uniswap behind in terms of cost and speed. The estimated cost for token swaps could drop as low as $0.001 for each trade. In addition, the transaction speed on the HECOChain-hosted DEX can achieve finality in as little as three seconds.At the time of this writing, MDEX dominates the DEX market’s trading volumes, commanding around 38-40% of the total market share, with a 24 hour volume of nearly $1.7 billion — this is twice that of previous leader Uniswap, which holds around a 23% share with $1.1 billion in volume. This comes as the governance tokens of the leading DEX protocols are soaring to new record highs. The vast majority of DeFi projects live on the Ethereum network as ERC-20 assets, but considering its status quo of expensive gas fees and slow transaction speeds, the worlds number two blockchain will to step up its game soon or risk having its DEX projects migrate to other more efficient chains for good. Most newly-developed protocols heavily consider scalability factors in their choice of blockchain networks if they want a fast adoption rate. Uniswap at least had an early-mover advantage, since it launched before the Ethereum network became heavily congested — and some say that Uniswap itself is one of the main reasons for the network’s congestion), However, Uniswap’s market majority could change really fast if second-layer solutions are not rolled out in time and deliver their expected results.Meanwhile, Huobi is aggressively expanding its reach in the space, firmly intent on further developing the HECO ecosystem.Check out Uniswap here.Check out SushiSwap here.Learn more about DEXs here.Read about crypto on the CMC blog.Uniswap is built on top of Ethereum, making it unavoidably connected to the smart contract-based blockchain network’s skyrocketing gas fees. As long as Ethereum 2.0 is not fully functional, DEXs that run on less-congested networks like Binance Smart Chain were bound to overtake Uniswap in terms of decentralized finance (DeFi) user onboarding and market volume at least temporarily, which is what played at the end of February 2021. On a side note, second-layer solutions like Optimism might help Uniswap’s scaling issues in the near future.Huobi, the Seychelles-based crypto exchange founded in China and listed in Hong Kong, is a leading trading platform with a deep footprint in Asian markets and millions of users. Huobi officially launched its eco-chain HECO in December 2020, where the new platform quickly surged in popularity thanks to a maximum 500 transactions-per-second (TPS) rate, transaction confirmation time of only three seconds and a ridiculously low GAS fee of only $0.001. These statistics have attracted new DeFi developers and other users looking for a platform with higher efficiency and transacting speeds, resulting in a total value locked (TVL) of over $1.38 billion and over 1,800,000 addresses by the beginning of February. There are instances where transactions made on MDEX can cost almost nothing, sometimes resulting in even negative charges, since users are given rewards for trading and mining, effectively canceling out the costs of transacting on the network. Recent reports say that MDEX has already handed out as much as $280 million in transaction mining rewards and $200 million in liquidity mining incentives.MDEX’s tokenomics follows a “repurchase and burn” model, which decreases the circulating supply of the MDX token over time, driving up its value. This model keeps the value of MDX sustainable over the long run. Its tokenomics are also further supported by the “repurchase and reward” model, which further incentivizes MDX holders to keep their tokens.On top of yield rewards, MDX tokens can also be used to participate in the governance mechanism of one of the fastest-growing DEXs in the market. Holders can propose and vote on the listing of a token on the MDEX market or collateralization of any other asset.MDEX is designed for users and project developers as it implements an automated market maker (AMM) that facilitates low slippages for trades, good market depth and high yields for transaction and liquidity miners. This makes it an attractive environment for DeFi projects.Huobi and HECO-based projects also enjoy the deployment of MDEX as it facilitates the trade of these networks’ supported assets. Even Ethereum-based DeFi protocols such as AAVE, BAL, LINK and YFI have also begun liquidity mining on MDEX.Mdex is trading on markets including Huobi Global, Gate.io and the MDEX exchange, among others.Learn more about how to buy crypto here." ;

		:about "Basic Attention Token, or BAT, is the token that powers a new blockchain-based digital advertising platform designed to fairly reward users for their attention, while providing advertisers with a better return on their ad spend. This experience is delivered through the Brave Browser, where users can watch privacy-preserving adverts and receive BAT rewards for doing so. On the other hand, advertisers can deliver targeted ads to maximize engagement and cut down losses due to ad fraud and abuse.The Basic Attention Token itself is the unit of reward in this advertising ecosystem, and is exchanged between advertisers, publishers and users. Advertisers pay for their advertising campaigns in BAT tokens. Out of this budget, a small portion is distributed to advertisers, while 70% is distributed to users — whereas the intermediaries that typically drive up advertising costs are cut out of the equation to improve cost-efficiency. Basic Attention Token launched in 2017 following one of the fastest sell-out initial coin offerings (ICOs) of all time, with the platform raising a total of $35 million in under a minute. Since then, it has rolled out its attention-based advertising experience to users in most countries through its Brave Rewards program. As of November 2020, the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada had the most active advertising campaigns.Basic Attention Token has two founders: Brendan Eich and Brian Bondy — two highly distinguished individuals in the internet browsing software industry. Brendan Eich is the CEO of Brave Software, Inc — the parent firm behind the Brave browser and Basic Attention Token. Prior to his role at Brave, Eich was the founder and CTO of Mozilla and also invented JavaScript in 1995. He also helped launch one of the worlds most popular web browsers in 2004 — Mozilla Firefox.Likewise, Brian Bondy joins as Braves and Basic Attention Token’s CTO. Bondy is a heavily experienced engineer with previous experience working as a senior software engineer at Mozilla, software developer at Corel Corporation and software development lead at Khan Academy. Together, Eich and Bondy have a combined 50+ years of software development experience. In total, the Basic Attention Token website lists 16 team members, many of whom have a development, engineering or research background.The primary use case for the Basic Attention Token is as a payment token for running advertising campaigns through Brave Ads. As of November 2020, advertisers must commit to a minimum ad spend of $2,500 per month to be able to launch their campaign, but a self-serve platform with potentially lower limits is currently in the pipeline. Currently, this advertising budget must be paid entirely in Basic Attention Tokens, which advertisers can acquire from a variety of third-party exchange platforms. Out of this, Brave takes a small commission, and the rest is distributed to publishers and users. One of the main distinguishing features about Basic Attention Token and the Brave Browser ecosystem is the capacity to reward (tip) users who are not yet part of the network — this includes both websites and individual Twitter users. These users can then securely register to the platform to collect any tips they have accumulated. Both Basic Attention Token and Brave Browser have achieved significant user uptake since their launch. As of October 2020, Brave Browser has a total of 20.5 million active monthly users, whereas the Basic Attention Token is now held by a total of more than 368,000 unique wallets.Check out Decentr (DEC) — a blockchain-powered web browser and web 3.0 portal.Explore AdEx Network (ADX) — the blockchain-powered advertising platform.Meet CoinMarketCap Alexandria — the compendium of crypto knowledge.Get ahead of the market with the largest news, analyses, and updates with the CoinMarketCap blog.Basic Attention Token has a maximum total supply of 1.5 billion tokens. This cannot be increased without switching to a new token smart contract.Almost all of this supply is in current circulation. As a result, Basic Attention Token can be considered almost fully diluted. In its 2017 ICO, a total of 1 billion BAT tokens were sold to investors, whereas the remaining 200 million tokens were locked in a development pool, and 300 million BAT was reserved for the user growth pool (UGP). As of November 2020, both the development pool and UGP pool addresses are nearly empty.Basic Network Token (BAT) is an ERC-20 token. As such, it is built on the Ethereum blockchain. Like any ERC-20 token, BAT is secured by a rigorously tested proof-of-work (POW) consensus algorithm supported by an extensive Ethereum miner network. This consensus algorithm ensures only valid transactions are confirmed, while the combined work of the Ethereum mining network ensures BAT transactions are essentially irreversible once confirmed. Basic Attention Token can currently be traded on the majority of popular cryptocurrency exchange platforms, and currently has excellent liquidity. Binance, Coinbase Pro and Huobi Global count among the most reputable exchanges for BAT trades. Like many cryptocurrencies, BAT can be purchased directly using fiat at a variety of brokers or can be traded against fiat assets on platforms like Kraken and Bithumb." ;

		:about "Synthetix is a decentralized finance (DeFi) protocol that provides on-chain exposure to a wide variety of crypto and non-crypto assets. The protocol is based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain and offers users access to highly liquid synthetic assets (synths). Synths track and provide returns on the underlying asset without requiring one to directly hold the asset.The platform aims to broaden the cryptocurrency space by introducing non-blockchain assets, providing access to a more robust financial market. The network was launched in September 2017 by Kain Warwick under the name Havven (HAV). About a year later the company rebranded to Synthetix.Kain Warwick is the founder of Synthetix and a non-executive director at the blueshyft retail network. Prior to founding Synthetix, Warwick has worked on several other cryptocurrency projects. He also founded Pouncer, a live auction site exclusive to Australia.Peter McKean, the project’s CEO, has over two decades of experience in software development. He previously worked as a programmer at ICL Fujitsu.Jordan Momtazi, the COO of Synthetix, is a business strategist, market analyst and sales leader with several years of experience in blockchain, cryptocurrency, digital payments and e-commerce systems.Justin J. Moses, the CTO, was the former director of engineering at MongoDB and deputy practice head of engineering at Lab49. He also co-founded Pouncer.Synthetix is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a platform for synthetic assets. The protocol is designed in a way that exposes users to the underlying assets via synths, without having to hold the underlying asset.The platform allows users to autonomously trade and exchange synths. It also has a staking pool where holders can stake their SNX tokens and are rewarded with a share of the transaction fees on the Synthetix Exchange.The platform tracks the underlying assets using smart contract price delivery protocols called oracles. Synthetix allows users to trade synths seamlessly, without liquidity/slippage issues. It also eliminates the need for third-party facilitators.SNX tokens are used as collateral for the synthetic assets that are minted. This means that whenever synths are issued, SNX tokens are locked up in a smart contract. Since launch, the protocol has transitioned to the Optimistic Ethereum mainnet to help reduce the gas fees on the network and lower oracle latency.The maximum supply of SNX is 212,424,133 coins, of which 114,841,533 SNX is in circulation as of February 2021.At the seed round and token sale stages, Synthetix sold more than 60 million tokens and was able to raise $30 million. Of the total 100,000,000 coins issued during the ICO, 20% was allocated to the team and advisors, 3% to bounties and marketing incentives, 5% to partnership incentives and 12% to the foundation.The SNX token is compatible with Ethereum’s ERC20 standard. The Synthetix network is secured through proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Synthetix holders stake their SNX and earn returns from the network fees.Another way for SNX stakers to earn rewards is via the protocol’s inflationary monetary policy, known as staking rewards. SNX tokens can be purchased at top exchanges, such as:If you are interested in learning more about how to buy Bitcoin, read CoinMarketCap’s full guide here." ;

Stable system: the protocol runs on two different tokens, the REV and the RVN, allowing for smooth functioning of the system. The RVN token helps facilitate interactions between users on the platform. Immutable information: The system does not allow both regular users and Revain itself to edit the information of other users.Revain was established in 2018 by a group of technology experts from Moscow, Russia.The platform was founded by Rinat Arslanov, who is also its current CEO. Arslanov is a venture capitalist and an entrepreneur with more than ten years of experience in the blockchain industry.Other notable team members include the CFO Grigor Aproyan, the COO Aleksey Belashenko the CTO Andrew Timokhin, the product owner Dmitry Bogachev, the designer Vlad Bocharov, the digital manager Ksenia Fendich, and the account manager Tatiana Muntyanu.Since its inception in 2018, the platform claims to have achieved the largest number of user reviews in the industry. Revain’s protocol consists of seven major blockchain divisions: projects, casinos, exchanges, mining pools, wallets, cards, and games.What differentiates the platform from other blockchain-based projects is that it utilizes two tokens to increase its efficiency. Another major component of Revain is its integration with the IBM Watson Tone Analyzer. Revain also allows companies to determine specific criteria for evaluating the quality of user-provided reviews. For instance, a company might require their reviewers to attach proof, increasing the credibility of reviews. Reviewers who fail to do so will then stand the risk of having their reviews rejected by the protocol. Initially, the platform started out with the R and RVN tokens. However, on March 26, 2020, the company swapped R for REV tokens due to the difficulty of integrating the former into other blockchains. The tokens currently used on the platform are the REV and RVN.RVN token is a stablecoin and is exclusive to the platform, as it has not been released into open circulation. The REV token, on the other hand, is fully tradable. Registered companies on the platform can use the REV token to incentivize authors to write reviews.The REV token is based on Ethereum’s ERC-20 standard, TRC20 and BEP20. REV is a utility token and is used for rewarding authors. As of February 2021, there are 85,061,485,690 REV in circulation.Read more about TRON.Find out more about Uniswap.Learn more about oracles.Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.There are several major exchanges that support REV trading, including:In addition, the gamification system on the platform allows users to earn RVN tokens as a reward for providing genuine reviews.

		:about "Founded in September of 2018, Paxos Standard is a flat-collateralized stablecoin. Stablecoins are cryptocurrencies that are designed to minimize the volatility of the price of the stablecoin, relative to a certain stable asset or a basket of assets. A stablecoin can be pegged to a cryptocurrency or flat money. In some cases, it can even be traded for commodities. Paxos Standard offers the advantage of transacting with blockchain assets through minimized price risk. The Paxos Standard tokens (PAX) are issued as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain and are collateralized 1:1 through the USD held in Paxos-owned US bank accounts.The Paxos Standard was created by Charles Cascarilla and Rich Teo.Charles Cascarilla is the CEO and co-founder of Paxos. He is also the founding board member of the Association for Digital Asset Markets (ADAM), and a partner at Liberty City Ventures.He also co-founded and is a partner at Cedar Hill Capital Partners, and his past experience includes a portfolio manager at Claiborne Capital Management, financial analyst at Goldman Sachs and analyst at the Bank of America.Rich Teo is the second co-founder of Paxos. Before that, he worked as a principal/senior Analyst at Cedar Hill Capital Partners. He was also a financial analyst at Citi, and a combat signaler at the Singapore Armed Forces. The Paxos Standard is a stablecoin that allows any user to exchange U.S. dollars for the Paxos Standard Tokens. Its main goal is to stabilize the dollar with blockchain technology. The Paxos company has a charter from the New York State Department of Financial Services that allows them to offer regulated services within the crypto asset world. The token itself is backed by the USD in accounts that are held by the company at the U.S. depository institutions. Paxos Standard was built in order to improve the larger financial ecosystem through the creation of a frictionless global network. Here, all digital assets can be mobilized quickly, with a high level of flexibility and accessibility. Paxos’s goal is to create a future where digital assets, commodities and securities can be transferred anywhere, anytime. Learn more about Uniswap.Paxos Standard combines the U.S. dollar’s stability with the efficiency of blockchain technology. It is a digital dollar, and like other crypto assets can be moved instantaneously anywhere in the world throughout any time of the day. It is stable and is backed 1:1 for the dollar, as well as issued by the Paxos Trust Company. This means that the funds are carefully protected, audited and regulated.The Paxos Standard (PAX) can be transacted over the Ethereum blockchain in the same way as Ether or any other ERC-20 asset. If a user wants to redeem PAX, they can send tokens to an address controlled by Paxos that will destroy the tokens and transfer flat currency to the user’s bank account. Through this existence on a public blockchain, it can allow traders and exchanges to use PAX as an alternative to flat currencies and can help them outsource their banking requirements to Paxos. This also allows Paxos to easily be integrated with the Ethereum based applications easily.When there is a security threat, Paxos can pause transfers and approvals of the PAX Token. This ability to pause is controlled by a single owner role, such as OpenZeppelin’s ownable. The model follows OpenZeppelin’s Pausable. OpenZeppelin contracts help you minimize risk by using tested libraries of smart contracts for Ethereum and other blockchains. Due to the fact that it has a regulated trust, Paxos can legally transfer assets and monies. Through combining that permission with blockchain technology, the transactions can be done rapidly, securely and with no risk. Paxos Standard or PAX can be purchased, sold and traded on several exchanges, those being: BinanceVCC ExchangeDigifinexBittrexBithumb Global1inch Exchange.You can find others listed on our crypto exchanges page.

		:about "Decentraland (MANA) defines itself as a virtual reality platform powered by the Ethereum blockchain that allows users to create, experience, and monetize content and applications. In this virtual world, users purchase plots of land that they can later navigate, build upon and monetize. Decentraland was launched following a $24 million initial coin offering (ICO) that was conducted in 2017. The virtual world launched its closed beta in 2019 and opened to the public in February 2020. Since then, users have created a wide range of experiences on their parcels of LAND, including interactive games, sprawling 3D scenes and a variety of other interactive experiences. Decentraland uses two tokens: MANA and LAND. MANA is an ERC-20 token that must be burned to acquire non-fungible ERC-721 LAND tokens. MANA tokens can also be used to pay for a range of avatars, wearables, names, and more on the Decentraland marketplace.Decentraland was co-founded by Ariel Meilich and Esteban Ordano — both of whom have stepped down from major positions at the project, but still work alongside Decentraland as advisors. Ariel Meilich previously held the role of project lead at Decentraland between 2017 and 2020, and is a serial entrepreneur that has founded several other startups, including an online translation agency and a CRM platform. He also worked as an analyst at Charles River Ventures, a prominent Silicon Valley venture fund. On the other hand, Esteban Ordano is Decentralands former tech lead and has a long and varied history in the cryptocurrency space working as a software engineer at BitPay, Inc., an advisor to Matic Network and briefly operated his own smart contract development firm known as Smart Contract Solutions. Esteban is also credited with co-founding Zeppelin Solutions, an established blockchain technology infrastructure company. Although Ariel and Estaban are no longer leading the project, the development of Decentraland is still ongoing, with efforts being directed by the recently established Decentraland Foundation. Decentraland is built for content creators, businesses and individuals that are looking for a new artistic medium, business opportunity, or source of entertainment.In total, the Decentraland gameworld — termed the “Metaverse” — is divided into 90,601 individual parcels of LAND, each of which is represented by an ERC-721 non-fungible token. Each LAND is exactly 16m x 16m (100 square meters) and can be found at a particular coordinate in the Metaverse. Though LAND holders are free to develop their plot into whatever they choose, much of the Metaverse is broadly divided into several districts, each of which has a different size and theme. These districts were generated through individual crowdsales for MANA tokens, and parcels of LAND in these districts cannot be traded. As of January 2021, the cyberpunk-themed Aetheria is the largest district — comprising a total of 8,008 LAND. Decentraland is also one of the growing number of projects to use a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) structure for governance decisions. As a result, MANA toker holders are in control of how the Decentraland world behaves, by proposing and voting on policy updates, the specifics of upcoming LAND auctions and the types of content that are allowed with the Metaverse.Besides being a creative outlet, many Decentraland users currently monetize their LAND through leasing, advertising and paid experiences. Likewise, other users generate an income by creating and selling items on the Decentraland marketplace for MANA tokens. Check out AnRKey X (ANRX) — the first game to merge DeFi, e-sports, and Web 3.0.Check out Axie Infinity (AXS) — a digital pet universe and decentralized trading game.Learn more about non-fungible tokens with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Get the latest crypto news and latest trading insights with the CoinMarketCap blog.As of January 2021, just north of 1.49 billion MANA tokens were in circulation. This is equivalent to around 68% of the current total supply of 2.19 billion MANA. The original total supply was set at 2.8 billion MANA, but has been reduced as more than 600 million MANA have been burned as a result of LAND auctions. There is also a range of further burn mechanisms in place to further reduce the circulating supply of MANA, including a 2.5% MANA burn on Decentraland marketplace transactions. MANA was originally designed to inflate at 8 percent in the first year, decreasing gradually over time to reduce the rate of inflation. But inflation is currently disabled. As per the Decentraland glossary, there are no plans to initiate this inflation until necessary.In total, 40% of the MANA supply was sold during the 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). In addition, 20% was reserved to incentivize the community, 20% went to the development team and other early contributors, and the remaining 20% was held by Decentraland. Project lead tokens are no longer vested. MANA is an ERC-20 token. This means it is based on the Ethereum blockchain.Ethereum is secured by a massive decentralized network of miners, which work together with thousands of nodes to ensure the Ethereum blockchain—and hence the MANA tokens—is protected against attacks. As one of the most battle-tested blockchains in current usage, Ethereum is currently the most popular network for crypto tokens that don’t have their own native blockchain. The MANA token currently benefits from excellent liquidity and can be purchased, traded or sold on around 100 different exchange platforms. As of January 2021, Binance, OKEx and Coinbase Pro are among the most liquid exchanges for MANA tokens. A full list of available markets can be found in the “Markets” section. MANA can currently be traded against Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT), and Ethereum (ETH) — and can be purchased with a range of fiat currencies, including KRW and USD." ;

		:about "Quant launched in June 2018 with the goal of connecting blockchains and networks on a global scale, without reducing the efficiency and interoperability of the network. It is the first project to solve the interoperability problem through the creation of the first blockchain operating system.The project is built as an operating system distributed ledger technology— and Overledger Network — for connecting different blockchain networks. The project is billed as the first OS to be built for blockchains.The main aim of Quant — using Overledger — is to bridge the gap that exists between different blockchains. The backbone of the project is the Overledger network, which Quant bills as the ecosystem on which the future digital economy ecosystem will be built. Overledger allows developers to build decentralized multi-chain applications (known as MApps) for their customers. For developers to build a Mapp on the network, they must hold a certain amount of Quant tokens (QNT).Gilbert Verdian, one of the founders of the Quant network, had the idea for the blockchain project while he was working in the healthcare sector. Verdian identified the importance of interoperability in ensuring that patients registered on different platforms are covered.Verdian has over 20 years of industry experience in upgrading the security, technology and business strategies of businesses around the globe in order to achieve tangible results. Prior to the Quant Network, Verdian served as the chief information security officer (CISO) of Vocalink, a Mastercard card company, the chief information officer of NSW Ambulance, the CISO of eHealth NSW, and the security lead of the Ministry of Justice, UK.The second co-founder, Dr Paolo Tasca, is an entrepreneur, digital economist who specializes in distributed systems. Dr. Tasca has served as the special advisor on blockchain technologies for the EU Parliament, the United Nations and numerous central banks worldwide.He is also co-author of several books on fintech and is the co-founder and governing board chair of Retail Blockchain Consortium.Since the introduction of blockchain and the distributed ledger technology, innovators have found use cases in almost every known industry. However, there has been the problem of seamless interoperability between these projects. Quant was created to be the missing link between the “different” blockchains.Quant’s operating system, Overledger, was designed to act as a gateway for any blockchain-based project to access all other blockchains. It also works in connecting an application to other applications in the same blockchain ecosystem, like Ethereum.More than multiple blockchain interactions, Quant creates different layers for apps to interact at different levels. Quant has different layers for transactions, messaging, filtering and ordering, and an application for sharing and referencing identical messages related to other applications.The Quant App Store has the ability to read and monitor transactions across multiple ledgers. Using Overledger, developers write smart contracts across a wide variety of chains including those that don’t support them — such as Bitcoin. Developers can also use the store to create and release multi-chain applications (MApps).Find out about Chainlink (LINK).Find out about Polkadot (DOT).Learn how to use Uniswap.Read up to date crypto news on the CoinMarketCap blog.Enterprises do not need to purchase the QNT tokens in order to use the Quant Network. However, they need the QNT tokens to use the network. A developer has to purchase a license (in QNT) to create anything on the platform. This requires tokens to be locked up for 12 months. The cost of running the Gateways and performing read/write operations on Overledger requires the use of the QNT tokens.The max supply of QNT tokens is set at 14,612,493 tokens. The QNT tokens were split in the following way:Currently, the circulating supply of the token is 12,072,738 QNT. The extra 2 million tokens are held by the company. These tokens are unlocked and could be sold or issued at any time.Overledger forms the backbone of the Quant Network. Overledger ensures communicability among DLT networks and interacts with different blockchains.The Overledger Network includes gateways for linking different blockchains. Similar to Ethereum’s proof-of-stake blockchains, the Quant Network community is involved in handling treasury smart contracts.The community handles QNT payments flowing from users to the gateways. They do this in a manner where people are held accountable to any observer.Quant tokens can be purchased, sold, and traded on several exchanges, includingBilaxyBittrexBithumb Global1inch ExchangeUniswap (V2), andHotbit. QNT can be traded against cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), stablecoins such as Tether (USDT), and fiat currencies such as the euro.Are you new to crypto and curious how to purchase QNT?

		:about "Stacks is a layer-1 blockchain solution that is designed to bring smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) to Bitcoin (BTC). These smart contracts are brought to Bitcoin without changing any of the features that make it so powerful — including its security and stability. These DApps are open and modular, meaning developers can build on top of each others apps to produce features that are simply not possible in a regular app. Since Stacks uses Bitcoin as a base layer, everything that happens on the network is settled on the most widely used arguably the most secure blockchain in operation — Bitcoin. The platform is powered by the Stacks token (STX), which is used for fueling the execution of smart contracts, processing transactions and registering new digital assets on the Stacks 2.0 blockchain. The platform was formerly known as Blockstack, but was rebranded to Stacks in Q4 2020 in order to separate the ecosystem and open source project from Blockstack PBC — the company that built the original protocols.The mainnet for Stacks 2.0 launched in January 2021.Stacks was initially funded by a range of prominent venture capital funds, including Y Combinator, Digital Currency Group and Winklevoss Capital. It was developed by Blockstack PBC, which has its headquarters in New York. Blockstack PBC now operates under the name Hiro Systems PBC and joins a wide range of companies building on Stacks platform.Blockstack PBC was founded by Muneeb Ali and Ryan Shea. After graduating from Princeton University with an MA and PhD in computer science, Muneeb Ali co-founded Stacks in 2013, and still works with the platform today as the CEO of Hiro Systems PBC. The second co-founder of the platform, Ryan Shea, also served co-CEO between 2013 and 2018, before disembarking from the project to pursue other ventures — including co-founding a new tech startup that is currently operating in stealth. Prior to his role at Stacks, Shea worked as a software engineer. Stacks looks to take what makes Bitcoin so powerful, and extends it with additional functionality, without needing to fork or change the original Bitcoin blockchain. It does this by connecting directly with the Bitcoin blockchain through its proof-of-transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism, which has miners pay in BTC to mint new Stacks (STX) tokens. Moreover, STX token holders can also stack (not stake) their tokens to earn Bitcoin as a reward. Stacks introduces a new smart contract programming language known as Clarity, which is designed to be both secure and easy to build with thanks to its unambiguous syntax. This smart contract-centric programming language is also used by the Algorand (ALGO) blockchain. On top of this, Stacks was the first cryptocurrency to receive SEC qualification for a sale in the United States, allowing it to launch a $28 million Reg A+ sale cash offering for its STX tokens in July 2019. Check out Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC) — an ERC-20 token backed 1:1 with actual BTC.Check out Bitcoin Cash (BCH) — a forked of Bitcoin with several significant changes.Learn about side chains with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Stay on top of the latest product updates, partnerships, and announcements with the CoinMarketCap blog.According to the recently revamped economic policy launched with Stacks 2.0, the supply of the newly unlocked STX in circulation will be reduced by around 10% between now and 2020 compared to the original schedule. In total, around 1.82 billion STX are expected to be in circulation by 2050, compared to around 739.7 million in circulation as of January 2021.As per the Stacks 2.0 whitepaper draft (v0.1), a total of 1,000 STX per block will be released in the first four years, decreasing to 500 STX/block in the subsequent 4 years, 250 STX/block in the next four years, and then 120 STX/block after that in perpetuity.In total, 6.6% of the initial genesis supply (1.32 billion STX) was allocated to the founder and a further 7.9% to the Stacks team. These are subject to a three year unlock schedule, with tokens next scheduled to unlock in November 2021.Stacks uses the Bitcoin blockchain as its base layer. As a Proof of Work (PoW)-based blockchain, Bitcoin uses the combined efforts of thousands of miners and nodes to protect the network against attacks by making it computationally and economically unfeasible to subvert the network. On top of this, Stacks introduces its own consensus model, known as proof-of-transfer (PoX), which is a novel mining mechanism that sees users transfer the base currency (BTC) to mine STX — effectively bootstrapping the security of the Stacks blockchain using BTC. STX is available to trade on several prominent exchange platforms, including Binance and KuCoin. For a full list of available trading pairs and supported platforms, see the markets section.

		:about "Bancor consists of a series of smart contracts that manage the on-chain conversion of tokens. The protocol makes it effortless and quick to convert tokens without having to go through an exchange. The protocols smart contracts manage the liquidity pools that connect various tokens available in the network. The major token used on the network is the “Bancor Network Token,” BNT. Currently, Bancor and Uniswap are the frontrunners for this new DeFi trend. Bancor was founded by Eyal Hertzog, Yudi Levi, and Galia and Guy Benartzi in 2017. It was named Bancor to honour John Maynard Keynes, who came up with the word 76 years ago to describe a supranational currency.Eyal Hertzog is the product architect of the protocol, BNT, and other products that utilize the network. He is a known voice in the crypto industry and has been a technology entrepreneur for over 20 years. He previously founded MetaCafe, a top video sharing site in Israel with over 50 million users.Guy Benartzi is the chief executive at Bancor. He also co-founded Mytopia in 2005, a company that develops cross-platform games for users on social networks. Galia Benartzi has been a technology entrepreneur for many years, and is a co-founder of the Bancor protocol. At Bancor, she is the business developer. She is also the CEO and founder of Particle Code. Yudi Levi is the CTO at Bancor. He has been a technology entrepreneur for over 20 years. He previously co-founded AppCoin, an app that allows communities to create their own currencies.Bancor enables the seamless conversion of tokens used in the network. This removes the need for an exchange or third-party platforms. The protocol also maintains several self-governing pools for tokens supported by the network. The uniqueness of Bancor is in their goal to create liquidity for altcoins and to remunerate liquidity providers. The protocol monotonously converts various crypto tokens into other tokens, including those running on other blockchains, without the interference of a third party. BNT, the protocol’s main token, is the default for all smart tokens created on the network. Bancor’s creation of smart tokens is the first of its kind to be built via blockchain technology. The protocol’s main objective for creating smart tokens is to provide a lasting solution to liquidity problems, hence making it different from other market makers. In January, Bancor made a move to provide more liquidity and awareness for its native token. Therefore, it distributed some ETH/BNT valued at $60,000 into various wallets that were holding a required minimum of BNT. In 2017, the protocol raised more than $144M during its initial coin offering.The protocol allows other tokens to be liquidated as well. However, these tokens (also called reserve tokens) must comply with ERC-20 or EOS standards. Bancor ecosystem supports a two-way token model: liquid tokens and relay tokens.A liquid token is an automated token with a single reserve that mints and destroys itself. It does this either by sending the reserve token to its smart contract or removing it from the smart contract. In order to use Bancor Network, a liquid token must have its reserve token either in BNT or a derivative of BNT. On the other hand, relay tokens are used in staking to provide liquidity. The token holders will get a percentage of the future earnings of Bancor. Relay tokens indicate the proportion of amount staked to the total value in the pool.The protocol’s smart token allows traders to provide liquidity for the pools available on the network. Anyone can contribute liquidity to the pools.When liquidity providers contribute liquidity to a pool, they are eligible to receive rewards for trades that pass through the pool. Liquidity providers will receive pool tokens that represent a percentage of their total stake.As at the time of this writing, Bancor has facilitated over $2 billion trades involving several tokens, as well as cross-chain tokens. The network has made millions through staking, which are distributed to BNT token stakers. Several exchanges that support BNT include Binance, Coinswitch and ZenGo. You can get more information here on how to buy BNT and other cryptocurrencies." ;

		:about "Bitcoin Gold was founded in 2017 to become a user-friendly alternative to Bitcoin. The BTG network aims to combine the security and sturdiness of the Bitcoin blockchain and its characteristics with the opportunity for experimentation and development. BTG enhances and extends the crypto space with a blockchain closely compatible with Bitcoin but without using resources like Bitcoin hash power or vying for the real Bitcoin title. The company aims to present a coin with the implementation capabilities of Bitcoin, however, expanding on the opportunities for DeFi and DApp developers to use the coin. Bitcoin Gold was founded by a group of enthusiasts with diverse backgrounds and skills. Hang Yin is a co-founder and lead developer at Bitcoin Gold. He graduated with a degree in computer science from Fudan University in 2015. His professional career started right after he graduated. In late 2015, Yin became a software engineer for Google. After three years with the tech giant, Hang Yin decided to venture into entrepreneurship by starting Bitcoin Gold. In 2018, he also participated in the founding of HashForests. Martin Kuvandzhiev is the second co-founder of Bitcoin Gold, and he is also a board member at the company. He graduated with a degree in computer software engineering from the Technical University of Sofia, and his professional path started as a food service worker at McDonald’s. In 2015, he became an assistant professor at the Technical University of Sofia, and in 2016, he started a job as a lead iOS developer at phyre JSC. Since co-founding Bitcoin Gold in 2017, he has also launched another company called GoStartups.net. Currently, Kuvandzhiev is also the CEO of Assetify. Bitcoin Gold is a unique combination of the inherent properties of the original Bitcoin blockchain and an innovative approach to blockchain development and applications. As a hard fork of the original Bitcoin token, BTG aims to revolutionize the mining process by introducing a new proof-of-work algorithm that combats the scalability issues Bitcoin struggles with. As an open-source protocol, Bitcoin Gold allows developers to participate in the governance and development of the blockchain freely. According to the company, this is a must-have requirement for pushing decentralization and one of the major points where Bitcoin struggles. Bitcoin Gold is one of the first hard forks of the original cryptocurrency, which has attracted institutional and enterprise investors’ attention. BTG is available on a wide variety of exchanges, as well as swap services and wallets. Lastly, Bitcoin Gold has been actively adopted by several online browsers and service providers. Read more about SafeYield.Find out more about DCTDAO.Learn more about GPU mining.Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.Bitcoin Gold has a maximum supply of 21,000,000 BTG tokens and a total supply of 17,513,924 BTG tokens. The current circulating supply is equal to the total supply. Out of the total amount of BTG tokens, 30% went towards the development of the blockchain and the project. Another 15% were reserved for ecosystem support and development, and another 15% were distributed amongst the BTG community. About 20% of the total BTG token supply was reserved for yearly expenses. Close to 7% of BTG tokens were set aside for bounties and app collaboration, while another 5% went towards rewards for the founding team. The remaining 8% of tokens went towards covering pre-fork costs and community development.As a Bitcoin hard fork, Bitcoin Gold relies on the proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanism. However, one of BTG’s main goals was to revolutionize the minting process by introducing the Equihash PoW, which favors GPUs for mining, unlike the Bitcoin blockchain. While Bitcoin relies predominantly on application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miners, This version of Equihash uses more memory than an ASIC can offer but runs fine on many graphics cards. Unlike the Ethereum blockchain, which relies on the proof-of-stake (PoS) mechanism and favors stakeholders, Bitcoin Gold places importance on the processing power miners have.As one of the first hard forks of Bitcoin, BTG is available on various exchanges. One choice is Binance, but other good options include:Find more information here about buying cryptos." ;

		:about "What Is Nano (NANO)?Billed as digital money for the modern world, Nano is a lightweight cryptocurrency that is designed to facilitate secure, practically instant payments, without fees, and addresses some of the major limitations of both legacy financial infrastructure, and many modern cryptocurrencies.Development of the project began in 2014 under the name RaiBlocks, and the coin (then termed XRB) launched the following year through a public faucet, which allowed users to claim small amounts of XRB after completing a captcha challenge. Users were allowed to complete as many captchas as they liked to increase their words — effectively trading their time and effort for XRB.RaiBlocks (XRB) was rebranded to Nano (NANO) in January 2018, with the new name chosen to better represent the speed and simplicity the project offers to users. It is a peer-to-peer platform that uses a unique block-lattice data structure to allow users to easily transfer value to one another without relying on centralized intermediaries. Unlike other platforms which typically use the combined proof-of-work of a massive mining network to achieve consensus, Nano instead uses a system known as Open Representative Voting (ORV) — which sees account holders vote for their chosen representative, who then work to confirm blocks of transactions securely. ORV makes Nano extremely energy efficient, positioning it as a more environmentally friendly alternative to proof-of-work (POW)-based cryptocurrencies. Nano was founded by Colin LeMahieu, a heavily experienced software developer and engineer with a wealth of experience working for prominent tech companies, including Dell, AMD and Qualcomm.Self-described as an inventor, LeMahieu has interests that range from space technology to physics and environmental sustainability, and is a well-known name in the digital currency space. He began working full time on Nano in 2017 and remains the CEO of the Nano Foundation — an organization created to drive the development and adoption of the Nano — to this day.Colin LeMahieu also pushed the vast majority of commits to Nano’s GitHub repo. Beyond LeMahieu, the Nano Foundation has over a dozen other employees, including George Coxon, a graduate in Evolutionary Anthropology and experienced account executive, and the current COO of the foundation. As we previously touched on, Nano is designed to be fast. So fast, in fact, that most Nano transactions reach absolute finality within less than a second — compared to several minutes or even longer for many other major cryptocurrencies. This speed makes Nano suitable for commercial payments, since merchants and retailers no longer need to worry about transaction delays when accepting payments. Moreover, Nano transactions are completely free. Since representatives do not receive financial compensation for their efforts to secure the network, there is no need for a transaction fee. This makes Nano an ideal solution for processing micro-transactions, since users no longer need to worry about fronting a potentially expensive transaction fee when making small payments. These features are enabled by its unique architecture. Unlike many cryptocurrencies which are built on top of a distributed ledger known as a blockchain, Nano is instead built around a similar ledger technology called a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure is highly reliable and allows Nano to process as many as 1,000 transactions per second (tps) — without requiring an energy-intensive mining network to maintain its integrity, positioning Nano as an eco-friendly digital payment option. Check out IOTA (MIOTA) — another DAG-based cryptocurrency with no transaction fees.Check out EOS (EOS) — a smart-contract capable blockchain with free transactions.Read Oracles: The All-Seeing Eyes That Guide Crypto Networks—a deep dive by CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Stay on top of the market with the latest tips, tricks, and trends with the CoinMarketCap blog.Like the vast majority of cryptocurrencies, Nano has a fixed maximum number of tokens that will ever enter existence, this number is set at exactly 133,248,290 NANO.The original maximum supply was set much higher than this, but any remaining NANO tokens above the current 133 million limit were permanently burned. In total, around 39% of the original genesis supply was distributed. Nano is unusual in the fact that its entire supply is already in circulation, this means it is fully diluted. Because it is fully diluted, Nano is also highly decentralized, and well distributed, with the vast majority of Nano accounts holding less than 100 NANO. As of December 2020, around 20% of all Nano in circulation (~26 million) is held in one of the cold wallets associated with the Binance cryptocurrency exchange. A total of 5% of the circulating supply was held back for the continued development of the project, this was allocated to a so-called “developer fund.” Nano is secured by a network of representatives, each of which is voted into position by NANO holders. These representatives are responsible for casting their votes when the network needs to achieve consensus, and their voting power is the sum total of the voting weight delegated to them by NANO holders. These vote on the validity of transactions on the Nano network, ensuring only valid transactions are confirmed. This process protects the network against a type of attack known as a double spend—which occurs when an attacker is able to manipulate the network to effectively spend the same funds twice. In addition, the Nano network features a wide variety of additional defenses against various possible attack vectors—a full overview of which can be found here. Since Nano cannot be mined, the most popular way to get your hands on some is by purchasing it from one of the more than 50 exchange platforms that support it. Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global are currently among the most popular exchanges for Nano to crypto trading pairs, whereas it can also be bought with fiat on Kraken and Binance.US.

		:about "Fantom is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) smart contract platform providing decentralized finance (DeFi) services to developers using its own bespoke consensus algorithm.Together with its in-house token FTM, Fantom aims to solve problems associated with smart-contract platforms, specifically transaction speed, which developers say they have reduced to under two seconds. The Fantom Foundation, which oversees the Fantom product offering, was originally created in 2018, with the launch of OPERA, Fantom’s mainnet, coming in December 2019.The Fantom Foundation was founded by South Korean computer scientist Dr. Ahn Byung Ik. Currently, the platform’s CEO is Michael Kong.The team behind Fantom has extensive experience primarily in the field of full-stack blockchain development, and aimed to create a smart contract platform which privileges scalability, decentralization and security.According to its official website, Fantom’s team also consists of specialist engineers, scientists, researchers, designers and entrepreneurs. Employees are located throughout the world, matching the ethos of a distributed platform. Fantom attempts to use a new scratch-built consensus mechanism to facilitate DeFi and related services on the basis of smart contracts.The mechanism, Lachesis, promises much higher capacity and two-second transaction finalization, along with improvements to security over traditional proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm-based platforms.Matching Ethereum, the project appeals to developers looking to deploy decentralized solutions. According to its official literature, its mission is to “grant compatibility between all transaction bodies around the world.”Its in-house PoS token, FTM, forms the backbone of transactions, and allows fee collection and staking activities, along with the user rewards the latter represents.Through token sales in 2018, Fantom raised almost $40 million to fund development.Find out more about Avalanche here.Find out more about Neo here.Find out more about Ethereum 2.0 here.New to cryptocurrency? CoinMarketCap’s dedicated information resource, Alexandria, can help you understand everything you need to know.FTM is a proof-of-stake (PoS) token which in fact exists in several incarnations. The platform’s compatibility with Ethereum means that users can purchase an ERC-20 standard FTM, which is automatically converted to native FTM once received to their wallet. Another version of FTM is available on Binance Chain using its BEP2 standard. Only the native FTM can be used on the Fantom OPERA mainnet itself.The total supply of FTM is 3.175 billion tokens, of which 2,134,638,448 FTM is currently in circulation. The rest will be released subject to a schedule running through 2023.Staking forms an important part of tokenomics, with a proportion of the supply reserved specifically for staking rewards to users who hold FTM.Fantom uses a bespoke variety of proof-of-stake algorithm to provide services and secure its network. Known as Lachesis, it is an example of a so-called asynchronous byzantine fault tolerant (aBFT) consensus mechanism.By removing leadership among network participants, Fantom avoids low-cost attack risk, while staking adds further user incentives to secure operations using FTM token holdings.Fantom’s FTM token is freely tradeable, and can be found on major exchanges such as Binance, Gate.io and OKEx Korea. FTM exists on several protocols, with ERC-20, BEP2 and Fantom’s own OPERA tokens all circulating.If you’re new to cryptocurrency and want to find out more about how to buy Bitcoin (BTC) or any other token, check out this information first." ;

		:about "DigiByte (DGB) is an open source blockchain and asset creation platform. Development began in October 2013 and the genesis block of its DGB token was mined in January 2014 as a fork of Bitcoin (BTC).A longstanding public blockchain and cryptocurrency, DigiByte uses five different algorithms to improve security, and originally aimed to improve on the Bitcoin blockchain’s security, capacity and transaction speed.DigiByte consists of three layers: a smart contract “App Store,” a public ledger and the core protocol featuring nodes communicating to relay transactions.DigiByte was created by Jared Tate, also known as “DigiMan,” who oversaw its metamorphosis from development to its current setup before announcing that he was temporarily retiring from his position in May 2020.Tate has since returned, and as of September 2020 once again appears closely involved with DigiByte’s growth.Tate’s biography states that he was involved with Bitcoin from 2012 onwards, and authored the first book written by a blockchain founder, “Blockchain 2035: The Digital DNA of Internet 3.0.”DigiByte’s operations depend not only on developers, but also the DigiByte Foundation, a volunteer organization tasked with overseeing preservation of the project. A third group of volunteers, the DigiByte Awareness Team, is responsible for marketing and promotional activities.DigiByte is a modification of Bitcoin which aims to diversify security, speed and capacity possibilities.Its first incarnation was as an open source blockchain and associated cryptocurrency, DGB. The network has five separate algorithms which help to maintain security and help prevent ASIC miners from commandeering too much power.Later, another offering, DigiAssets, appeared, with DGB as its native token. DigiAssets appeals to those developers looking to launch digital assets, decentralized applications (DApps) and encode the necessary corresponding smart contracts.All governance structures for DigiByte are run on a voluntary basis, in line with the thesis that the network should be open source and publicly accessible. Transaction fees in DGB are paid to miners for validating the blockchain.Find out more about Litecoin (LTC) here.Find out more about Ethereum (ETH) here.New to cryptocurrency? Find out everything you need to know with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.DigiByte (DGB) is a proof-of-work (PoW) cryptocurrency, and miners earn tokens for validating blocks via block rewards.In January 2014, 0.5% of the total DGB supply (105 million coins) was premined. 50% of the premine was reserved for development purposes, while the remainder was given away. DGB has a hard supply cap of 21 billion tokens, with mining forming an emission curve with decreasing issuance — the block reward reduces by 1% each month.DigiByte has stated that it purposely did not try to raise funds or give away tokens through instruments such as an initial coin offering (ICO) or similar token sale.DigiByte uses a total of five proof-of-work algorithms to secure the blockchain and reduce the risk of double spending or 51% attacks. Difficulty adjustments ensure resilience against hostile moves within mining circles, with DigiByte claiming to have the most advanced such difficulty setup among cryptocurrencies.With roughly one block every 15 seconds, DigiByte’s blockchain has managed to prove the longevity of its PoW blockchain since launch, now having a much longer chain of PoW than, for example, Bitcoin.DGB is a freely-tradable altcoin and is available on multiple exchanges. Trading pairs are available for cryptocurrencies, stablecoins and fiat currencies. Bilaxy, Binance, Sistemkoin and OKEx had the lion’s share of volume for DGB trading pairs as of September 2020.New to crypto? Find out how to buy Bitcoin or any other token here." ;

		:about "Harmony is a blockchain platform designed to facilitate the creation and use of decentralized applications (DApps). The network aims to innovate the way decentralized applications work by focusing on random state sharding, which allows creating blocks in seconds.According to the project’s website, Harmony is expected to introduce cross-shard contracts and a cross-chain infrastructure by the end of 2021.Stephen Tse is the founder and CEO of Harmony. He has a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, specializing in cryptographic protocols and type theory.While finishing his degree, Dr. Tse became a research intern at Microsoft. In 2006 he started working as a senior engineer at Google, spending four years in the company. In 2011 he founded Spotsetter, a successful search engine which Apple later acquired. In 2014, Dr. Tse became the principal engineer for Apple. He founded Harmony in 2017. The Harmony founding team comprises twelve people, with seven of them being former employees at Google, Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon.Focusing on processing speed and validation, the Harmony mainnet aims to revolutionize block creation. By introducing the sharding process, the company reduced node validation times significantly. To ensure the protection of nodes and secure the validation process, Harmony introduced the Verifiable Random Function (VRF) for unbiased and unpredictable shard membership. This means that nodes and validators are assigned and re-assigned in a randomized manner. The project’s Harmony Grants program is an initiative that aims to support innovation and attract developers to the Harmony mainnet.Read more about Plasma Finance.Find out more about Loopring.Learn more about DApps.Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.Harmony (ONE) has a maximum supply of 12,600,000,000 tokens. As of February 2021, the circulating supply on the market is about 9,486,327,268 ONE. Out of the total supply of ONE tokens, 22.4% were dedicated to the initial seed sale. Another 12.5% were set aside for an additional Launchpad sale. The Harmony founding team and developers received 16.9% of the total supply. About 26.4% of ONE tokens were dedicated to protocol development, while another 21.8% were directed towards ecosystem development.Harmony introduces a new version of the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus. Called effective proof-of-stake (EPoS), this method allows simultaneous staking from hundreds of validators. This consensus method was developed in accordance with the sharding concept utilized in the Harmony network. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) consensus mechanisms, EPoS is designed for faster processing times and improved scalability. While PoW requires a lot of electrical and computing power, staking consensus methods rely on an abundance of value holders, who become validators. Harmony is also looking to boost staking incentives to attract more node operators. The Harmony Open Staking initiative encourages interaction with the network and incentivizes stakeholders with the highest amount of ONE tokens.

		:about "UMA, or Universal Market Access, is a protocol for the creation of synthetic assets based on the Ethereum (ETH) blockchain. UMA was launched in December 2018.Synthetic assets are a class of assets that represent different, underlying assets and have the same value. UMA specifically enables its users to design and create self-executing, self-enforcing financial contracts secured by economic incentives and run them on Ethereum’s blockchain.In essence, UMA allows counterparties to digitize and automate any real-world financial derivatives, such as futures, contracts for differences (CFDs) or total return swaps. It also enables the creation of self-fulfilling derivative contracts based on digital assets, like other cryptocurrencies.UMA was co-founded by Hart Lambur and Allison Lu, who met on the Goldman Sachs trading floor.In 2005, Lambur graduated from Columbia University with a computer science degree. In addition to co-founding UMA, he is also the CEO and co-founder of Risk Labs, the company in charge of developing the Universal Market Access protocol.Prior to UMA and Risk Labs, Lambur worked as a research assistant at Columbia and as a government bond trader at Goldman Sachs. He has also founded and headed Openfolio, a personal finance tracking platform which he sold to Stone Ridge Asset Management in 2017.Allison Lu has received a degree in Economics and Management from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.Between 2009 and 2015, she worked as a vice president at Goldman Sachs, where Lu and Lambur met. Afterward, Lu worked as the VP of credit & risk analysis at the financial services mobile app Tala. She was also an advisor at One Daijo, an Ethereum-based peer-to-peer lending platform.The main idea behind Universal Market Access is reflected in its name: by developing a protocol for the creation of synthetic assets and financial contracts on the blockchain, it seeks to democratize and decentralize the financial derivatives market.The traditional financial markets have high barriers to entry in the form of regulations and custody requirements, which tend to preclude individuals from participating in them. It is often especially difficult for would-be traders and investors to take part in markets outside of their local financial system. This prevents the emergence of a truly inclusive global financial market and limits participation to a handful of institutions that can afford the necessary due diligence and legal procedures.UMA contracts, on the other hand, are based on Ethereum’s blockchain, whose permissionless nature allows any user to create, run and trade digitized derivatives from anywhere in the world. This accessibility is especially important for the developing economies around the globe, where financial institutions are frequently far from maturity, forcing local market participants into relative isolation.Looking for more projects that aim to disrupt the industry of finance? See our DeFi page.Access more info about Ethereum, the platform UMA is based on.UMA is the governance token of the Universal Market Access protocol, meaning that its holders have the right to vote on changes to the protocol’s parameters and system upgrades.The total supply of UMA is a little over 100 million tokens, of which about 55 million are in circulation as of October 2020.From the total supply, 2 million tokens were sold during the project’s initial coin offering (ICO), 48.5 million were reserved for the founders of the project, 35 million were put aside as rewards for the developers of the protocol and 14.5 million designated for future sales.In order to incentivize voter participation, every time a voting process takes place on the network, an inflationary reward equal to 0.05% of the current UMA supply is distributed among active voters proportionate to their current stake.UMA runs on top of Ethereum’s blockchain and as a consequence, they are protected by the same proof-of-work hash function Ethash.UMA can be bought at multiple major cryptocurrency exchanges, some of the largest of which are:" ;

		:about "Curve is a decentralized exchange for stablecoins that uses an automated market maker (AMM) to manage liquidity.Launched in January 2020, Curve is now synonymous with the decentralized finance (DeFi) phenomenon, and has seen significant growth in the second half of 2020.In August, Curve launched a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), with CRV as its in-house token. The DAO uses Ethereum-based creation tool Aragon to connect multiple smart contracts used for users’ deposited liquidity. Issues such as governance, however, differ from Aragon in their weighting and other respects.The founder and CEO of Curve is Michael Egorov, a Russian scientist who has various experience with cryptocurrency-related enterprises.In 2015, he co-founded and became CTO of NuCypher, a cryptocurrency business building privacy-preserving infrastructure and protocols.Egorov is also the founder of decentralized bank and loans network LoanCoin.Curve’s regular team is part of the CRV allocation structure, and will receive tokens according to a two-year vesting schedule as part of the initial launch plan. In August 2020, Egorov said that he “overreacted” by locking up a large amount of CRV tokens as a response to yearn.finance’s voting power, awarding himself 71% of governance in the process.Curve has gained considerable attention by following its remit as an AMM specifically for stablecoin trading.The launch of the DAO and CRV token brought in further profitability, given CRV’s use for governance, as it is awarded to users based on liquidity commitment and length of ownership.The explosion in DeFi trading has ensured Curve’s longevity, with AMMs turning over huge amounts of liquidity and associated user profits. As such, Curve caters to anyone involved in DeFi activities such as yield farming and liquidity mining, as well as those looking to maximize returns without risk by holding notionally non-volatile stablecoins.The platform makes money by charging a modest fee which is paid to liquidity providers.Find out more about Uniswap (UNI) here.Find out more about SushiSwap (SUSHI) here.Cryptocurrency newbie? Get all the information you need about the industry with Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.Curve (CRV) launched in August 2020, along with the Curve DAO. Its purpose is to function as a governance medium, incentive structure and fee payment method, along with long-term earnings method for liquidity providers.The total CRV supply is 3.03 billion tokens, the majority of which (62%) are distributed to liquidity providers. The remainder is divided as follows: 30% to shareholders, 3% to employees and 5% to a community reserve. The shareholder and employee allocations come with a two-year vesting schedule.CRV had no premine, and the gradual unlocking of tokens means that around 750 million should be in circulation one year after launch.Curve carries the standard risks associated with depositing funds in smart contracts and dealing with AMMs, namely impermanent loss.As Curve only supports stablecoins, the risk of markets moving too quickly is reduced, but users can still lose money once markets are rebalanced to reflect cross-market prices.Curve has been audited, but this does not do anything to counter the risks involved in being exposed to a specific cryptocurrency.CRV is a freely-tradable token and is available against cryptocurrency, stablecoin and fiat currency pairs on major exchanges.These include Binance, OKEx and Huobi Global, which hold the lion’s share of trading volume as of September 2020.New to cryptocurrency and want to know how to buy Bitcoin (BTC) or any other token?

The BAKE token is a native BEP-20 governance token on the platform.Users have the ability to earn BAKE tokens by providing liquidity on BakerySwap, and BAKE holders can use their tokens for governance voting and to receive transaction fee dividends. The BAKE rewards are offered in several liquidity pools, initially including BTC, ETH, DOT, LINK, BUSD and BAKE versus BNB.The team behind BakeryToken is an anonymous group of developers who believe in the future of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).Bakery Swap runs on the Binance Smart Chain. The BAKE-BNB pool is expected to provide ten times the rewards compared to other pools.BakerySwap, a Binance Smart Chain-based AMM, offers liquidity pools for altcoins such as LINK, DOT and others. It works through initial liquidity pools. BakerySwap has two types of liquidity pools: with BAKE rewards and without them. This is done in order to facilitate the creation of new liquidity pools by the community.Only designated pools will have BAKE rewards. The reward multiplier for each will vary based on the value they provide to BAKE holders. BakerySwap charges a 0.30% fee on all swaps and trades, out of which 0.25% go to liquidity providers.The liquidity providers are then given liquidity pool tokens that represent their share of each pool. Through these tokens, they can earn a portion of the fees that are collected in the pools when removing the liquidity. Liquidity providers can then stake Bakery LP tokens to farm BAKE token rewards.

		:about "Qtum (pronounced ‘“quantum”) is a proof-of-stake (PoS) smart contract open-source blockchain platform and value transfer protocol. It aims to bring together the strengths of Bitcoin and Ethereum in one chain. Qtum is built on Bitcoins UTXO transaction model, with the added functionality of smart contract execution and DApps. Recently, the platform added support for DeFi applications. As of March 2021, there are more than 20 tokens created on the Qtum blockchain.The project was announced in March 2016 and held an ICO a year after, in March 2017, which brought its founders $15 million USD. The Qtum main chain was released on Sept.13, 2017. Initially, the Qtum coin was issued as a ETH-20 token, but with the launch of the mainnet, it was converted to native blockchain.Patrick Dai is the project’s founder and the chairman of the Qtum Foundation. He studied computer science in Draper University and then dropped out of PhD from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. He started his career as a product manager at Alibaba and then worked on a series of blockchain projects, including Factom, Vechain, Bitse Group and Meilink before starting Qtum in 2016. It should be noted that he was previously once known under the name of Steven Dai, when he was the CTO of the infamous BitBay project, which has allegedly been subject of an exit scam scandal. The other two co-founders are the CTO and blockchain architect Neil Mahi and lead developer Jordan Earls.Stephen (Xiaolong) XU is a lead developer of Qtum since 2017, he previously worked at Tencent and Microsoft as a software developer and has a degree in Computer Vision from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences. Many of the team members listed on the Qtum official website seem to not have an active Linkedin page or a Github profile. It is confirmed though that Qtum has several high-profile backers, including the Bitcoin.com’s Roger Ver and Jeremy Gardner, an early crypto investor turned skincare professional, co-founder of Augur and EIR in Blockchain Capital.Qtum is a general purpose blockchain that tries to address four issues its founders found most problematic in BTC and ETH blockchain platforms: interoperability, governance, rigidity and costliness of proof-of-work mechanism and difficulty of connecting smart contracts with real life applications. The Qtum blockchain has two unique technologies that aim to solve that: Account Abstraction Layer (AAL) and Decentralized Governance Protocol (DGP). The Account Abstraction Layer integrates the UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output) account layer inherited from Bitcoin with the smart contract layer, inspired by Ethereum. It allows users to build applications and host them on virtual machines, including the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), and the x86 virtual machine. It also supports i686 instruction set and several programming languages like C, C++, Rust and Python, which makes it very easy to adopt existing apps and compile for Qtum. Not only does it allow turing-complete smart contracts, Qtum also plans to integrate common programming libraries in the form of smart contracts.The Decentralized Governance Protocol allows smart contracts to change the core parameters of the network such as block size and gas fees without ever needing to hard fork the blockchain, which may save a lot of trouble as the network is evolving. Miners (stakers), developers and QTUM holders within the entire ecosystem are involved in blockchain governance through voting, and the blockchain can realize self-management, upgrades and iteration. Take a good look into Ethereum, the first cryptocurrency, supporting smart contracts.How well do you know Cardano? Be sure not to miss our deep dive.Ready to learn more? Visit our learning hub.Check out our blog for the latest crypto news and insights.According to the Qtum whitepaper, the initial supply of QTUM coins was 100 million, all of which were minted instantly before the project went online. 51 million coins were sold to the public through an ICO process in March 2017. Over that, 8 million coins went to the early private investors and 12 million were allocated to the project team with a four-year lock-up. The rest is controlled by the Qtum Chain Foundation, a non-profit company registered in Singapore, which will receive it in four parts by March-2021. These are 20 million coins allocated for business development purposes and 9% for academic research and promotion. The coin supply is not fixed, new tokens can be mined with block reward halving every four years from the initial block reward subsidy of 4.0 QTUM per block, going through seven halvings to eventually reaching zero by year 2045, when the maximum supply will reach 107,822,406 QTUM.The technical approach to Qtum is not the same as Bitcoin and Ethereum currently use. Qtum chose the MPoS (mutualized proof-of-stake) consensus mechanism for network security. It is a modified version of Proof-of-Stake 3.0. The protocol incentivizes users to keep their coins locked to facilitate and secure the block validation. This is called staking. Confirming each block is a competition between coin holders, where based on connectivity to the network and random chance they get to right to validate the block. Unlike the early PoS protocols, here the block reward is constant and does not depend on coin age for determining the likeliness of getting it. The rewards are spread proportionally to the stake, so the more coins are staked, the more reward the user gets. On top of that, the MPoS protocol is protected against “junk contract” attacks by splitting 10% of the block reward between the block producing miner and nine previous miners and delaying the remaining 90% by 500 blocks in the future. Unlike the proof-of-work mechanism used in Bitcoin, the proof-of-stake algorithms are significantly less costly to maintain, are more environmentally friendly and can provide a great deal of decentralization, which is the cornerstone of blockchain security.QTUM is a freely-tradable token, available on most exchanges. Pairs available for trading include Bitcoin and altcoins, stablecoins and fiat money.The top exchanges for trading in Qtum are currently Binance, Huobi Global, OKEx, HBTC and Hydax Exchange.

Its mainnet was launched in April 2020.The platform has two native tokens. CELO is a proof-of-stake (PoS) token used for transaction fees, governance participation and related activities. In future, the platform aims to host various stablecoins, with one, the Celo Dollar (CUSD), already in use.Celo was originally founded by a team comprised of people from MIT, Stanford, Google, Square, Circle, Visa, GoDaddy, World Bank, Federal Reserve Bank, Harvard University, University of Pennsylvania Law School, Cambridge University, U.S. Department of Justice, Bank Of America, Capital One, Twitter, Give Directly, and the Gates FoundationSeparate entities are aimed at Celo’s promotion and preservation. The dedicated Celo Foundation is a non-profit which launched along with the mainnet, while the Celo Alliance for Prosperity is what the company describes as an “ecosystem of mission-aligned organizations.”Celo’s main unique selling point lies in its focus on smartphone users. The company argues that the number of smartphone owners is increasing exponentially, but the number of people using cryptocurrency is rising at a much slower pace.Cryptocurrency is further highly suited to regions in which a large section of the population does not have access to the banking sector, but still has a smartphone.Bridging the gap between the two technologies is what Celo aims to do, along with harnessing the benefits of DeFi by supporting the creation of DApps and smart contracts.Optimized for mobile, the Celo blockchain automatically calculates transaction fees, and also allows users to pay the gas fees which power transactions in any currency.Read more about Facebook Libra here.Crypto newbie? Find out everything you need to know on Alexandria, CoinMarketCap’s dedicated education resource.Click here to check out CoinMarketCap’s blog.CELO and CUSD perform complementary functions within the Celo platform. CELO has a capped supply of 1 billion (1,000,000,000) tokens, of which 600 million were available when the mainnet launched in April 2020.The last 40% of the supply will be released gradually via fees and rewards, and various vesting schedules are in place depending on how initial investors received their tokens.In addition, up to 120 million CELO will go towards a reserve designed to maintain the validity and price stability of CUSD. As a stablecoin, CUSD is envisioned as a convenient payment method for Celo users who will not have to worry about their holdings fluctuating in value.Celo uses proof-of-stake to maintain security, and has a complex election process to determine validators of its blockchain.Holders of CELO are able to use their holdings as a means of participating in elections by voting for groups of validators.CELO is a freely tradable cryptocurrency on the ERC-20 token standard, available at various major exchanges.

		:about "Ontology is a high performance, open source blockchain specializing in digital identity and data. Ontologys unique infrastructure supports robust cross-chain collaboration and Layer 2 scalability, offering businesses the flexibility to design a blockchain that suits their needs. With a suite of decentralized identity and data sharing protocols to enhance speed, security, and trust, Ontology’s features include ONT ID, a mobile digital ID application and DID used throughout the ecosystem, and DDXF, a decentralized data exchange, and collaboration frameworkAt its launch, Ontology chose to forego the popular initial coin offering (ICO) model in favor of a series of community distributions and airdrops of its ONT cryptocurrency, which began life as a NEP-5 token on the NEO blockchain. This helped to quickly establish both organic price discovery and a passionate community and helped the project to avoid subsequent regulatory scrutiny.For example, for a brief period any person who signed up for the Ontology newsletter received an airdrop of free 1,000 ONT, which reached a value of $10 per token soon after the token became listed on major exchanges like Binance. Ontology launched its own MainNet on June 30, 2018 and now operates independently from the NEO blockchain. Ontology was established by Li Jun, Founder of Ontology. During Ontology’s early stages of development, Ontology received technical support from some members of Onchain’s developer team. However, the two have always been officially separate projects pursuing their own goals. Ontology offers a variety of real-life use cases and allows businesses to build their own blockchain on top of the Ontology blockchain. Importantly, Ontology offers more flexibility for enterprises, allowing them to create customized blockchains to fit their specific needs in terms of features like governance and enhanced privacy, functionality that competitors like Ethereum and NEO lack by design.The ONT chain also helps negate transaction network fees by generating and distributing free Ontology Gas (ONG) to ONT holders based on their holdings. Ontology further provides additional features such as smart contracts, cryptographic identity proofs (ONT ID) and tokenized data (DDXF) that can seamlessly be transferred between different blockchains. Example: A patients medical records, subject to strict data privacy laws in most countries, may be utilized across the Ontology network without compromising the integrity and privacy of the patients data. The medical business that is transferring the confidential data is able to control what is shared with other parties and under which conditions, with no fear of patient data falling into the hands of unauthorized parties.

Ontology has a total coin supply of 1,000,000,000 ONT, of which nearly 80% are currently in circulation. At its launch, 15% of ONT tokens were allocated to its core team, 10% to the NEO council, 28% to institutional partners, 10% to its technical community and 25% to the development of its ecosystem.These tokens were subject to a strict screening process and various unlocking periods that ran over two years until the end of October 2020. Read more about its token distribution here. The Ontology network is fully decentralized and therefore highly resistant against hacks, which would have to affect over half of the connected devices to make an impact. Both ONT and ONG are listed and supported by the world’s leading exchanges such as Binance and OKEx, with the exception of Coinbase. It is now possible to buy Ontology and other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin To find out how, read more here." ;

		:about "KCS is the native token of KuCoin, which was launched back in 2017 as a profit-sharing token that allows traders to draw value from the exchange. It was issued as an ERC-20 token running on the Ethereum network and was supported by most Ethereum wallets. The total supply of KCS was set at 200 million, and there is a planned buyback and burn until just 100 million KCS remain. Sooner or later, as the KuCoin decentralized trading solution goes live, KCS will be the native asset of KuCoins decentralized financial services as well as the governance token of the KuCoin community in the future.KuCoin has also announced that “Empowering KCS will be a key priority of KuCoin and will build KCS as a killer product rather than a simple token, which is bound to further diversify the benefits that KCS holders can access. In the long run, KCS performs as the key to the entire KuCoin ecosystem. With the development of DEX and KuChain, KCS will also be the underlying fuel and general token for future KuCoin decentralized products. More details will likely be released in the near future.KCS Bonus is regarded as one of the best ways to get passive income. Users who hold more than 6 KCS can get a daily dividend, which comes from 50% of KuCoins daily trading fee revenue. KCS Bonus is a unique incentive mechanism for KCS holders and KuCoin ecosystem builders. The amount of rewards that users can get depends on the number of KCS held and the trading volume of the KuCoin Exchange.Besides being paid out as a dividend, KCS, as a utility token, is also used to pay for trading fees on the KuCoin Exchange, allowing users to enjoy discounts of up to 80%. The use case of KCS also includes participation in the token sale on KuCoin Spotlight, as well as LockDrop/BurningDrop on the Pool-X platform. But this is not all, as KCS tokens also serve a series of other purposes on the platform. For instance, KCS holders can become KuCoin VIPs and users no longer need to have a huge BTC trading volume to unlock the reduced maker and taker fees. KCS can also be used as a payment method for shopping, making hotel reservations, buying gaming equipment, and more.The KCS initial supply was set at 200 million. KuCoin and the KCS team are buying back KCS from the market and burning them every quarter. The amount of KCS to be burneddepends on the quarterly trading volume of the KuCoin Exchange. So the circulating supply of KCS is decreasing and will eventually settle down at 100 million.KuCoin employs the standard encryption protocol that ensures that user data and data transfers within the system are hidden from other users.It uses a multi-cluster and multi-layer architectural system that can accommodate more than one transaction at the same time, ensuring system stability throughout every transaction.The KuCoin Exchange is a cryptocurrency exchange headquartered in Singapore. It launched on September 15, 2017. The company was originally co-founded in 2013 by the following people: COO Eric Don, marketing director Jack Zhu, president of business operations John Lee, operations and maintenance director Kent Li, chief legal consultant Linda Lin, CEO Michael Gan and CTO Top Lan.Learn more about 1inch.Learn more about The Graph.Learn what the typical crypto owner looks like on CMC Alexandria.Stay up to date on all crypto-news with the CoinMarketCap blog.KuCoin Token’s (KCS) circulating supply is at 80,118,638 KCS as of February 2021, with a maximum supply of 170,118,638 KCS.KuCoin Token (KCS) trading can be found on the following exchanges:If you are curious about learning how to trade Bitcoin, you can find all of the(https://coinmarketcap.com/how-to-buy-bitcoin/)information you need here." ;

:coin_1896_ZRX rdf:type owl:NamedIndividual ,
                           :Coin ;
		:about "0x is an infrastructure protocol that allows users to easily trade ERC20 tokens and other assets on the Ethereum blockchain without relying on centralized intermediaries like traditional cryptocurrency exchanges.0x achieves this decentralized exchange functionality using a collection of open-source, publicly auditable smart contracts that work together to produce a flexible, low-friction trading protocol that developers can easily weave into their products. The protocol is powered by an ERC20 utility token known as ZRX. Nodes that (also known as relayers) host an off-chain order book and offer user-facing applications that present this information and allow users to make, fill and cancel transactions are paid in ZRX tokens (as trading fees). ZRX can also be used to participate in platform governance, helping holders suggest and vote on changes to the protocol. In 2019, 0x announced an overhaul of the ZRX token, adding extra functionality, allowing ZRX holders to delegate their stake to a market maker to earn passive rewards while retaining their voting capacity. 0x was founded in 2016 by Will Warren and Amir Bandeali. The two co-founders continue to serve the platform, with Will Warren as 0xs CEO, whereas Amir Bandeali is CTO.The platform launched following a successful initial coin offering (ICO) in 2017, during which it raised a total of $24 million — with support from prominent investment firms including Polychain Capital, Pantera Capital and FBG Capital. Prior to the sell-out ICO, Warren worked in several research roles and briefly held the role of technical advisor to Basic Attention Token (BAT). Bandeali, on the other hand, graduated from the University of Illinois with a BSc in Finance and held several trading positions before co-founding 0x. Now the team is composed of more than 30 individuals, including engineers, researchers and designers who work to update the platform and keep it running smoothly. Unlike many other Ethereum decentralized exchange protocols, 0x supports both fungible (ERC20) and non-fungible (ERC-723) tokens. This means it can be used for the permissionless trading of a wide range of assets, giving holders a way to buy, sell and exchange the vast majority of Ethereum assets through more than a dozen different apps. The 0x protocol can be applied to a wide range of use cases, including eBay-style marketplaces for digital goods and services, OTC trading desks, exchange functionality for DeFi protocols and plain-old decentralized exchanges. Although 0x can be used to build highly flexible exchange products, it can also be built into products where asset exchange is a secondary feature — such as for in-game purchases and portfolio management platforms. On the 0x protocol, liquidity takers pay a fee in the form of ZRX tokens — this fee is used to incentivize market maker (relayer) liquidity. Users also need to pay a protocol fee in the form of Ether (ETH), which is used to pay for the gas used in any transactions they complete. As an open-source protocol, 0x does not receive any share of this revenue, and is instead supported by ZRX tokens unlocked as team and developer incentives — along with its initial ICO funding. Find out about Uniswap (UNI) — a modern alternative to 0x.Click here to learn how to use Uniswap as a beginner.Check out Ferrum Network (FRM) — a platform used for building blockchain-based financial products.(https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/ferrum-network/)Stay up to date with the latest news with the CoinMarketCap Blog.Like many digital assets, the ZRX token has a fixed maximum supply that will never be exceeded. This is set to 1 billion ZRX. Right now, around three quarters of this maximum supply is already in circulation, and just a small fraction of this is locked up for staking rewards. Unlike many protocols, 0x has never publicly described the emission rate for new ZRX tokens, making it difficult to say how long it will take until the circulating supply is fully diluted. But with 50% of the circulating supply released when the token launched in August 2017 and 75% of the supply released as of October 2020, this indicates it may achieve full dilution in the early 2020s. As per an early blog entry by 0x CEO Will Warren, half of the total ZRX token supply was sold to investors in the 2017 ICO, whereas 15% each is reserved for the 0x core development organization and external project development fund, while a further 10% is reserved for the founding team with a four year vesting schedule and one year cliff, and the remaining 10% is retained for early backers and advisors.0x is built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. As a result, it is protected against attacks by the combined efforts of the massive Ethereum miner and node network.As for the underlying smart contracts, version 3 of the protocol has been audited by several third party firms which checked to see if there were any underlying vulnerabilities, backdoors and redundant functions, including ConsenSys Diligence — no major issues were found. However, a vulnerability was found in the v2.0 smart contract, which was later patched by the 0x core team. This vulnerability was detected by an independent researcher and was not exploited. 0x continues to operate a generous bug bounty, to help detect and patch any issues before they can be exploited.ZRX is currently available to trade on well over 200 different exchange platforms, but the most popular ones include Coinbase Pro, Binance and BitMax. It can currently be traded against a range of other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Tether (USDT) and Ethereum (ETH), as well as several fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR) and South Korean won (KRW).

		:about "Launched in 2017, Livepeer is the first live video streaming network protocol that is fully decentralized. The platform aims to become a viable blockchain-based, economically efficient alternative to centralized broadcasting solutions for all new and existing broadcaster companies. As stated in the official Livepeer whitepaper, the live video streaming and broadcasting industry is growing at a rapid pace, and the company is looking to ride this wave and introduce decentralization to the environment. Livepeer aims to streamline the broadcasting process by allowing producers to submit their work on the platform, taking care of reformatting and distributing the content to users and streaming platforms. Livepeer is an open-source protocol, which means that developers can freely contribute to the underlying code on GitHub. Livepeer Inc is the legal entity behind the Livepeer platform. Livepeer Inc was founded by Doug Petkanics and Eric Tang.Doug Petkanics graduated with a degree in computer science from the University of Pennsylvania in 2006. Since then, he has been an integral part of several big names like Groupon and Wildcard. In 2006, he joined Accenture as an analyst, and in 2010 he co-founded Hyperpublic, which Groupon later acquired. In 2013, Petkanics co-founded Wildcard, a publishing platform, and web browser. Since 2016, he has been at the center of development for Livepeer.Eric Tang graduated with a degree in electrical and computer engineering from Carnegie Mellon University. In 2008, he joined Next Jump as a software developer, and in 2010 he became a product manager for Clickable. In 2010, he teamed up with Doug Petkanics and co-founded Hyperpublic. Since then, the duo has worked together on Wildcard and later on Livepeer. Livepeer is a unique project because it aims to revolutionize the broadcasting industry by employing the powers of blockchain technology. The open-source platform allows users and developers to participate in the management and improvement of the platform freely. The growing capabilities of digital cameras for producing high-quality video content drive the development of the broadcasting industry, and Livepeer aims to further boost this process by allowing users to benefit from decentralized computing power and crypto-economic incentives for bootstrapping and participation.Livepeer is becoming a leading industry platform, as it allows users to participate in numerous ways. The platform offers opportunities for pay-as-you-go content consumption, auto-scaling social video services, uncensorable live journalism, and video-enabled DApps. Livepeer is transforming the live video streaming process and is on the road to becoming an industry leader. Read more about Basic Attention Token.Find out more about NEAR protocol.Learn more about transactions on the blockchain.Have a look at the CoinMarketCap blog.Livepeer has a maximum supply of 22,906,951 LTP tokens and a total supply of 22,859,012 LTP tokens. The circulating supply is 21,164,655 LPT.Of the total supply, founders and early team members split amongst themselves about 12.35%, which has a vesting period of 36 months from network launch. Another 19% of tokens were directed towards pre-sale purchases. The largest amount of tokens, 63.437%, was distributed towards crowd sales. Finally, 5% of the total token supply is reserved for maintaining the Livepeer network, ensuring the project’s future development. As Livepeer is built on the Ethereum blockchain, the platform utilizes a modified version of a delegated proof-of-stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism. In a DPoS mechanism, there is no mining at all. Instead, the validation of new blocks on the blockchain happens based on the number of coins staked. This is what differentiates Livepeer from consensus mechanisms as the one Bitcoin uses. While Bitcoin’s proof-of-work (PoW) mechanism requires a large amount of electrical and computing power, the DPoS systems are more ecologically conscious and easily scalable. Not only that, LIvepeer benefits from the extensive DApp universe already established by the Ethereum blockchain, which further boosts the usability of the network. Livepeer (LPT) tokens are becoming an increasingly sought-after asset, which is why more exchanges are starting to offer trading pairs with the cryptocurrency. If you are looking to purchase LPT, your best bet is Gate.io.Other recommended exchanges include:It is important to note that purchasing cryptocurrency bears risk, just like investing in any other asset.

		:about "OMG Network, formerly known as OmiseGo, is a non-custodial, layer-2 scaling solution built for the Ethereum blockchain. As an Ethereum scaling solution, OMG Network is designed to allow users to transfer ETH and ERC20 tokens significantly faster and cheaper than when transacting directly on the Ethereum network. The network is based on a novel scaling solution called MoreViable Plasma, which uses a sidechain architecture to group several transactions off-chain into a batch, which can then be verified as a single transaction on the Ethereum root chain. According to OMG Network, this technology has the potential to scale Ethereum to thousands of transactions per second (TPS) — instead of the 10 to 14 tps Ethereum 1.0 is currently capable of. The network is powered by the OMG utility token, which can be used as one of the payment methods for fees on the OMG Network, and will eventually be stakable — helping to secure the network in return for rewards. The OMG Network currently consists of a team of more than 50 employees scattered across the world. It was founded by Thai-born Vansa Chatikavanij and operates as a subsidiary of SYNQA — a Thailand-based fintech firm that was formerly known as Omise Holdings.As the projector founder, Vansa Chatikavanij received a master’s degree in earth and environmental sciences at New Yorks Columbia University. Following this, Chatikavanij held several consulting roles at prominent financial institutions including the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Bank Group, before founding OMG Network (then OmiseGo) in 2017. Chatikavanij held the role of managing director at the company until 2019, before transitioning to the role of CEO, which she still holds to this day. Beyond this, Stephen McNamara — former head of blockchain R&D strategy at Huawei Technologies — is OMG Networks COO, whereas Kasima Tharnpipitchai, a heavily experienced engineer and consultant, is its CTO. OMG Network believes that Ethereum’s significant speed and cost barriers will need to be overcome before mainstream businesses will consider building their products and applications on the network. As such, the OMG Network project is built to help make Ethereum more attractive to businesses and projects that want to scale while simultaneously cutting down on their carbon footprint. It achieves this with its plasma-based sidechain solution, which can help reduce electricity usage by up to 99% compared to Ethereum and cut fees by around two thirds, while ensuring assets remain secured by the underlying Ethereum network. The platform itself is supported by $25 million in funding obtained during its 2017 initial coin offering (ICO). Moreover, OMG Network parent firm SYNQA recently raised a further $80 million in Series C funding — and was supported by several major investment firms, including Toyota Financial Services Corporation and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation.Read about Stellar — one of OMG Networks biggest contenders.Find out more about Polkadot — a high-speed smart-contract capable blockchain.Take a deep dive into Ethereum 2.0 with CoinMarketCap Alexandria.Stay on top of the latest trends with the CoinMarketCap Blog.Like most cryptocurrencies, OMG Network tokens have a fixed maximum supply. This is set at exactly 140,245,398 OMG and will never increase beyond this point. Unlike many other cryptocurrencies, this total supply has already been fully minted, with the majority already in active circulation. Of the total supply, 65.1% of tokens were distributed to investors and 5% were distributed in an airdrop, whereas the last 29.9% is held by the project and team. Of this 29.9%, 20% is locked in the OMG Network reserve smart contract for funding future developments and network validation, and the remaining 9.9% is reserved for the founding team.Both the OMG reserve and team allocation were locked for one year, but this has since elapsed. The OMG Network mainnet will eventually move to a proof-of-stake (POS) consensus system, which will allow users to stake their tokens to help secure the network and earn rewards. Until then, OMG Network child chains are secured by a proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus mechanism, which is basically a simplified form of proof-of-stake which is controlled by a single block producer (OMG Network itself) for now — which essentially stakes its reputation on staying honest. OMG Network plans to transition to proof-of-stake as soon as it’s ready, following which OMG holders will be able to become stakeholders in the success and security of the network, by delegating their stake to validators. OMG tokens are highly liquid and can be purchased or traded on well over 200 different exchange platforms, including several top 10 exchanges — such as Coinbase Pro and Binance. Some of the most popular trading pairs include OMG/USDT, OMG/BTC and OMG/ETH.OMG can also be traded against several fiat currencies, including U.S. dollars (USD), euros (EUR) and British pound sterling (GBP).

		:about "Venus is an algorithmic-based money market system designed to bring a complete decentralized finance-based lending and credit system onto Binance Smart Chain. Venus enables users to utilize their cryptocurrencies by supplying collateral to the network that may be borrowed by pledging over-collateralized cryptocurrencies. This creates a secure lending environment where the lender receives a compounded interest rate annually (APY) paid per block, while the borrower pays interest on the cryptocurrency borrowed. These interest rates are set by the protocol in a curve yield, where the rates are automated based on the demand of the specific market, such as Bitcoin. The difference of Venus from other money market protocols is the ability to use the collateral supplied to the market not only to borrow other assets but also to mint synthetic stablecoins with over-collateralized positions that protect the protocol. These synthetic stablecoins are not backed by a basket of fiat currencies but by a basket of cryptocurrencies. Venus utilizes the Binance Smart chain for fast, low-cost transactions while accessing a deep network of wrapped tokens and liquidity." ;
